OVERVIEW

GENDRIVE is a utility that allows OrCAD users to modify the internals
of a generic driver so that a new driver can be created that provides
the proper functionality and performance for the graphics card.
GENDRIVE can handle most display adapters that claim to be EGA or VGA
compatible with resolutions up to 800 horizontal x 600 vertical.


CAUTION

A GENDRIVE produced driver has limited checking for adapter compatibility.
If video adapter and the new driver are not compatible, you may see either
a blank screen or a screen that has random looking patterns on it that do
not make sense. If you select one of the predefined driver configurations,
this shouldn't happen to you, but if it does, you may need to re-boot your
computer to get back to DOS by holding the Ctrl and Alt keys down and
pressing the Del key.


HOW TO USE

1) Switch to the directory containing GENDRIVE.EXE, GENDRIVE.DAT and
   GENDRIVE.DRV.  This will normally be your DRIVER directory.  If you set
   up your directory structure as OrCAD recommends, this will be:
       \ORCAD\DRIVER
   Type:  cd \orcad\driver        and press the ENTER key.

2) Invoke GENDRIVE.EXE
   Type: gendrive                 and press the ENTER key.

3) GENDRIVE.EXE will initialize itself and read in the OrCAD supported
   set of configurations from GENDRIVE.DAT.  It will then display the
   driver description part of this as a set of menu choices.

  At this point, there are 4 things you can do:
     1) Type the number associated with your display adapter and press ENTER.
     2) Press the M key to see More menu choices.
     3) Press the Q key to Quit the GENDRIVE program. No updates will occur.
     4) Press the S key to define a Special set of parameters.

  If you type a number and press ENTER, the file GENDRIVE.DRV will be modified
  with the associated set of parameters. You will be asked for a new file name
  for the modified driver.  After getting the name, GENDRIVE.EXE writes the
  modified driver to the disk and exits.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In most cases, you should be able to find a menu choice that supports
  your display adapter. If you do, the rest of this document can be ignored.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you press the S key, GENDRIVE.EXE will ask you to define the following
  parameters:
    1) The number of columns of pixels your display adapter supports.
       Typical numbers here are 640, 752 and 800.
    2) The number of rows of pixels your display adapter supports.
       Typical numbers here are 350, 410, 480 and 600.
    3) A value to be assigned to AX to set up for an Interrupt 10H.
    4) A value to be assigned to BX to set up for an Interrupt 10H.
       The AX and BX values must be consistent with the columns and rows
       provided in 1 and 2 above.  The values for AX and BX can be gotten
       from the technical reference or programmer's reference portion of
       your display adapter's user manual.
       Standard EGA/VGA values normally have AH=0 and AL equal either
       10 (EGA 640x350) or 12 (VGA 640x480).   Hence, AX = 0010H or 0012H
       for these.  Extended EGA cards often use AL=12H for 640x480 mode.
       The values for sizes above 640x480 vary considerably.  In addition,
       certain cards want to use a value for AH other than 0.


  The GENDRIVE approach is designed to handle display adapters that follow
  the general conventions of native mode EGA and VGA displays.
    1) Display Buffer starts at address A000:0
    2) There is less than 64K of addressable display memory.
       Size of memory required by a display =  rows * cols / 8.
       Example:  640x480 ==> 640 * 480 / 8 = 38400 bytes.
       Note: 800x600 ==> 800 * 600 / 8 = 60000 bytes which is just less
             than 64 kilobytes.  (1024x768 is too large.)
    3) OrCAD uses 16 colors.  This implies that the Display Buffer
       is really composed of 4 bit planes of 64K bytes each.
    4) Pixels are stored 8 pixels per apparent byte. With the high order
       bit of Byte A000:0 representing the upper left most bit on the screen.
    5) The number of columns must be a multiple of 8. That is, no byte contains
       bits from both the right end of a line and the left end of the next line.
       (We know of no adapters that violate this rule.)
    6) The mapping from bits on screen and in memory must be continuous.
       For example, if byte n contains the last 8 bits on line m, then
       byte (n+1) contains the first 8 bits on line (m+1).  (Various adapters
       and modes violate this rule. For example, CGA and Hercules Graphics
       modes.)

GENDRIVE Control File: GENDRIVE.DAT

  GENDRIVE is controlled by an editable file called: GENDRIVE.DAT. You
  may alter this file to make a Special (S) definition process into
  menu choice.  You might do this if you have a large number of users
  and a small variety of non-OrCAD-supported adapters.  If you choose
  to edit the file, make sure your editor can output ASCII compatible
  files containing only Carriage Return - Line Feed Sequences as line
  separators.

GENDRIVE.DAT Format

  1) Any line that starts with a semicolon is a comment.  Any line that does
     not start with a comment must be a mode specification.
  2) A mode specification consists of 5 fields separated by commas:
     Driver Description, Columns, Rows, AX value, BX value.
     - Driver Description: text that will display during application
       initialization.  Normally contains Columns x Rows and display adapter
       description.   This field can be enclosed in either single or double
       quotes.  If the field contains an embedded comma, then it must be
       enclosed in quotes.  If the field contains an embedded comma and a
       single/double quote, use double/single quotes to enclose it.
       Example Driver Descriptions:
          EGA 640x350 16 color                       no quotes
          "EGA 640x350 16 color"                     optional quotes
          'EGA 640x350 16 color'                     optional quotes
          "EGA 640x350, 16 color"                    required quotes (,)
          "John's Favorite Display Card"             optional double quotes
          John's Favorite Display Card               enclosing quote not needed
     - Columns: the number of columns of pixels the display will support.
         Enter this number in decimal. Example values are: 640, 752 and 800.
     - Rows: the number of rows of pixels that the display will support.
         Enter this number in decimal. Example values are: 350, 480 and 600.
     - AX value: The value to be MOVed into AX before doing an INT 10H to
         initialize the card. Enter this number in hexadecimal. (Hexadecimal
         is used here because most manuals show the numbers in hex.)
         Example values are: 0010H (EGA 640x350) and 0012H (VGA 640x480)
     - BX value: The value to be MOVed into BX before doing an INT 10H to
         initialize the card. Enter this number in hexadecimal. (Hexadecimal
         is used here because most manuals show the numbers in hex.)
         Example values are: 0H (most cards/modes) or 0010H or 0012H. The
         latter two values cause 640x350 and 640x480 modes for some extended
         EGA cards.
