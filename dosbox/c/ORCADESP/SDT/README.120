SDT 386+ v1.20 Release Notes
Updated September 7, 1994
*************************
New In SDT 386+ v1.20
*************************
* ASCII Input/Output of schematic files
You can now decompile entire designs into ASCII files for 
editing with your choice of text 
editors and then recompile them into SDT 386+ binary 
schematic files.  This facilitates 
global editing features such as substituting one part for 
another throughout your design.

* 32-bit printing and plotting
SDT 386+ now supports 32-bit scaled printing and plotting 
for faster operation and 
increased capacity.  Printing and plotting also support new 
font options allowing you to 
use printer and plotter fonts or to always use fonts 
identical to the display fonts.

* On-line scaled printing
The "Hardcopy" command in Draft allows you to perform scaled 
printing, just like Plot Schematic's "Plot to Printer" option.  
Now you don't have to leave Draft to print a C-sized 
sheet on A-sized paper.

* Print a selected block of your schematic
You can use Draft's "Hardcopy" command to print a selected 
block.  You can scale the printout and send the output to 
the printer, or a file.

* Enhanced forward ECO capability for OrCAD PCB 386+, EDIF 2 0 0 and 
PADS
Unlabeled nets will maintain the same name each time a 
netlist is generated.  This facilitates improved forward ECO 
capabilities 
for OrCAD PCB 386+, PADS and other EDIF targets.

* Comma-delimited Partlist output from Create Bill of Materials
Create Bill of Materials can optionally produce a comma 
delimited partlist for exporting to databases or spreadsheets 
to create custom bill of materials.  Each part is listed on a 
separate line with all eight part fields.

* Create named properties in EDIF netlists.
When generating an EDIF netlist, you can convert part fields 
into named properties. Named properties are used by many systems 
that read EDIF netlists as a mechanism for passing information 
from the schematic designer.

* Create hierarchical references to externally generated netlists
Hierarchical symbols can now reference netlists as well as 
schematics.  This is particularly useful when creating and 
simulating "board-level" schematics for FPGA designs, where 
one or more parts represents a synthesized or optimized 
netlist.

* Improved error checking for multi-page designs
Check Design Integrity now checks for unmatched module ports 
in flat (linked) designs as well as hierarchies.

* Drag large blocks using the "Block Drag" command
Drag as large a block as you wish without encountering "Out 
of Memory" messages.

************************************************
SDT 386+ Features (Features not available in SDT Release IV)
************************************************
* Virtually unlimited capacity
SDT 386+ uses 32-bit addressing and data structures, 
accessing extended memory (not EMS) to overcome the 640K limit.  
As a result, capacity has increased tremendously over SDT Release IV.

* Text rotation options
Comment text and label text may be rotated so that it is 
sideways-readable or upside down.

* Smart "Get Part" command
When the menu of parts is on the screen, typing a character 
causes the highlight bar snap to the first part whose name 
begins with that character.  When each successive character is 
typed, the highlight bar snaps to the next matching item.  
You can also use the <Page Up>, <Page Down>, <Home> and <End> 
keys to browse the part list.

* Easy file selection for Draft and Edit Library
Both Draft and Edit Library now have scrolling lists to make 
selecting files easier.

* Enhanced "Library Browse" command
The Library browse command now includes a "Get" command 
which retrieves the current part for placement.

* "Pin Repeat" command for Edit Library
A "Pin Repeat" command has been added to Edit Library.  This 
command repeats placement of the last pin , with the specified X,Y 
increment, automatically incrementing the pin name and pin number 
(where applicable).

* Easy "Block Copy" operations
A "Block Copy" command has been added to Draft.

* Easily move Sheet Nets
A Move sheet net command has been added in Draft.

* Enhanced "Block Import" command
The block outline and contents of the block are shown to 
allow accurate placement of the imported block.

* Enhanced "Inquire" command
The "Inquire" command now tells the original part name and 
the library name which a part is loaded from.

* Flexible graphic parts
Graphic parts may now have virtually unlimited body sizes.  
In addition, graphic grid arrays (i.e. single part per 
package graphic parts with alphanumeric pin numbers) may now 
be created.

* Easier netlisting
A new processor tool Check Design Integrity has been added 
that combines Cleanup Schematic, Cross Reference Parts, and 
Check Electrical Rules to perform all of the checks recommended 
before netlisting.

* Extended ASCII character support
Extended ASCII can be placed anywhere text can be placed 
except pin names and pin numbers.

* Full-screen "crosshair" cursor option
A new full screen "crosshair" cursor allows independent 
movement of the horizontal and vertical crosshairs to allow 
easier alignment during placement and editing functions.

* Simplified custom netlist format file creation
You create custom netlist format files for SDT 386+ using 
"C".  These makes custom netlist formats faster and more 
flexible than the interpreted formats of SDT Release IV.  In 
addition, a single batch file may now be used to set up and 
compile netlist format files.  This batch file is more 
flexible, has improved error checking and also checks your 
environment to make sure it is set up correctly.

*******************************
SDT 386+ system requirements
*******************************
* IBM 80386, 80486, Pentium or compatible
* At least 2 megabytes of available RAM (4 to 8 megabytes 
available RAM recommended for optimal performance).
* 7-10 megabytes of hard disk space
* SDT 386+ may be run in a full-screen DOS session under 
Microsoft Windows 3.1.

Performance notes
*******************************

1. Regarding single node nets. The netlist program INET 
only includes unconnected pins in its output when the
Assign a net name to all pins option (/I switch) is used. 
The part with the unconnected pins must appear on the schematic. 
When the unconnected pins belong to an unused gate in a 
multiple part package (and so it does not appear on the 
schematic), INET does not add these nets to its output.  

The incremental netlist linker, ILINK, produces a report
of all single net nodes when the Report single net nodes option 
(/N switch) is used. It operates on the files produced by INET.
If the single node net is not picked up by INET, it will not
be shown in the report ILINK produces. 

2. Plotting or printing to a COM port.

Before using Plot Schematic (PLOTALL) or Print Schmatic (PRINTALL) 
to print to one of the COM ports, be sure the COM port is set up 
correctly by entering the following mode command at the DOS prompt:

mode comx: 96,n,8,1,p

If the port has not be set up correctly and your schematic is
large enough to overflow the COM port buffer, you will see the
message:

Unable to write printpath. MS DOS Error #14 Disk is Full

If you are running under Windows, you will need to enter this 
command before invoking Windows. The most convenient way to make 
sure that this command is issued is to put it into your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

If you prefer to enter the mode command after Windows is running, 
you need to go to the Windows Control Panel for Ports. Click on the 
COM port in question, and then Settings. Change the control flow 
setting to hardware. Now entering the mode command in a DOS prompt
window will change the setting.
