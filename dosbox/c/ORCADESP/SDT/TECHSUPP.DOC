
			     TECHNICAL SUPPORT

_____________________________________________________________________________


Solving technical problems need not be difficult. This note will help you to
understand OrCAD's Technical Support. On occaision, technical problems can be
solved quite easily. This note also describes some of the basic tests used to
analyze a software problem.

==============================================================================
			       GENERAL NOTES
==============================================================================
RESOURCES |   Refer to any documentation containing information pertinent to
	  |the particular program. Also review the View Reference files for
	  |additional information.
	  |   The OrCAD Bulletin Board System features the technical database
	  |which contains many questions and answers of a technical nature.
	  |See the BBS.TXT file under View Reference for more details.
	  |   OrCAD staffs a well-trained Technical Support department.
	  |Telephone hours for Technical Support are 8 AM to 4 PM Pacific
	  |Time. Phone (503)-671-9400. The 24-hour FAX line is (503)-671-9501.
	  |Please have your customer registration number ready when you call,
	  |or include it on your fax. Each OrCAD product has its corresponding
	  |registration number. When you contact OrCAD regarding a product,
	  |please supply the registration number for that product.
	  |
	  |
	  |   Please be near your computer when you call. If possible, have a
	  |copy of exact error messages or symptoms handy. When supplying
	  |information, please be as complete and specific as possible.
	  |   OrCAD has one of the best Technical Support departments in
	  |the industry, but at times even our phone lines can be busy. Please
	  |be patient; we will answer your questions as soon as possible.
	  |   Please write down the name of the engineer that you speak with.
	  |Sometimes you may need to call back about a problem, so you will
	  |want to continue speaking with the same engineer. After you give
	  |the operator your registration number, please ask for the engineer.
----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
SENDING   |   At times, OrCAD may request that you send design files in order
FILES     |to solve a problem. Please be sure to include a READ.ME file which
	  |contains your name, phone number, registration number, address and
	  |an explanation of the problem and the files that you are sending.
	  |Normally, you should send design files (Schematics, stimulus files,
	  |etc.), custom library files, configuration files and any files
	  |pertinent to the problem. Also, please provide complete information
	  |about your system: the CHKDSK report, AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, 
	  |the ESP.CFG configuration file, and so on. Also, include exact 
	  |error messages and conditions. Files can be sent by diskette or 
	  |by the OrCAD Bulletin Board System. OrCAD can sign non-disclosure
	  |agreements when necessary.

			      TIPS AND TECHNIQUES                            2
----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR     |   OrCAD's ESP design environment automatically creates a text 
	  |file with the messages generated by a tool. The default name for 
	  |the text file is #ESP_OUT.TXT. This redirection file is recreated 
MESSAGES  |every time that you launch a process.
	  |   If a program encounters a warning or an error during its
	  |execution, ESP will show a window with the message "The program did
	  |not complete successfully". This window gives a selection of
	  |"OK" or "View Output". Selecting "View Output" will load the
	  |#ESP_OUT.TXT file into the text editor so you can view the messages
	  |created by the tool. Some tools place the exact errors in other
	  |report files, but often the #ESP_OUT.TXT file will contain an
	  |indication of the error.
	  |   Since the file is recreated every time that you launch a
	  |process, if you wish to save an error message, you will need to
	  |save the #ESP_OUT.TXT file. You can save the file by immediately
	  |exiting ESP without running any other process. You can also save
	  |the file by immediately going to Design Management Tools and using
	  |the File View function called Rename File. You can rename the
	  |#ESP_OUT.TXT file to some other file name, which will remain until
	  |you delete it.
----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
CHKDSK    |   Use the DOS program, CHKDSK /F, to test and correct your system.
	  |The program should not report any errors, such as Lost Clusters or
	  |Lost Allocations. If it does, convert those and reload any affected
	  |software. Your DOS manual will have more specific information
	  |regarding CHKDSK.
	  |   Part of the report shown by CHKDSK will display memory
	  |conditions. The last item of the report, "Bytes Free", will show
	  |how much of the 640K region of memory is available for a program.
	  |This number should be at least 560K.
	  |   Also, just above the Bytes Free listing you should see "Bytes
	  |Total". This number indicates the total memory region of 640K. The
	  |exact number (which we refer to as 640K) should be 655360. If this
	  |number is not 655360, you will need to investigate further. Causes
	  |could be many; possibly it is a result of programs using this
	  |memory region in an unusual fashion. You should be aware of such
	  |programs. They may have an effect on OrCAD software's operation.
	  |Some virus programs attempt to "hide" in this memory region.
----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER     |   Run anti-virus software. Eliminate any viruses and reload the
SOFTWARE  |software if any were detected.
	  |   As a test, clear out any resident programs. The AUTOEXEC.BAT and
	  |CONFIG.SYS files both load programs automatically every time that
	  |you start the system. Ideally programs would all be written to
	  |respect other programs. Such is not the case. Use the REM (remark)
	  |in AUTOEXEC.BAT to turn off some of the programs. Try the same for
	  |the "DEVICE= " statements in CONFIG.SYS.
	  |   Another more thorough approach to this would be to rename
	  |AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS so that DOS ignores them when the
	  |system initializes. All that OrCAD needs present are the four SET
	  |statements in AUTOEXEC.BAT that pertain to OrCAD, and for the OrCAD
	  |executable directory to be in the PATH statement.
