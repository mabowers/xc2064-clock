
        UNDERSTANDING CHECK ELECTRICAL RULES AND CREATE NETLIST

_____________________________________________________________________________

The information generated by Check Electrical Rules can sometimes be
confusing. This note should help to minimize the confusion.

Check Electrical Rules helps you to verify your schematic design. It warns you
if certain conditions exist in your design. The severity of the specific
problem may prevent completion of the design. Other conditions are subject to
your judgement and may be of no consequence.

Check Electrical Rules uses the decision matrix located in the Configure
Schematic Tools menu. It also uses a set of pre-determined rules, which are
part of the executable code. If you wish to turn off the pre-determined rules,
select the "Do not report warnings" (/A) option in the local configuration.
This will make all contention decisions be based entirely on the decision 
matrix.

Generally, you should run Check Electrical Rules seperately from the Create
Netlist process. This allows for more efficient netlist creation, and also
allows you to concentrate on netlist-specific problems if they should occur
during the Create Netlist process. Once you are satisfied with the results of
design tests like Check Electrical Rules, then proceed with the creation of a
netlist. (A good suite of tests is Cleanup Schematic, Cross Reference Parts
using mismatch and identical reports, and Check Electrical Rules.)

Use Check Electrical Rules as a guide to verify the integrity of your design.
It is only a guide. It is possible to generate a valid netlist even if Check
Electrical Rules reports errors. Errors such as parts with no pin names need
correction. Others, such as an output pin connected to a power object, may be
intentional and ignored. Such errors actually may help to confirm that your
pins are connected as intended. If you run ERC as part of the netlist process,
any errors must be corrected or the programs will not continue. If any
warnings exist, you can ignore these by selecting the "Ignore warnings" option
in the local configuration of INET. You may also wish to tailor the decision
matrix to suit your tastes.

Check Electrical Rules has a net-oriented perspective of the design. If the
report lists an error at a location, remember that the location is only one
point on the net. Check Electrical Rules will define the location of the
contention at the first item that it knows about in the net. An unconnected
pin (without a No-Connect object on it) is the only item on that net, so the
location of the warning is exact. On the other hand, a warning or error
regarding a power net may or may not be located at the point of contention.
The power net may have power objects and hidden power pins located at many
points on the schematic. Finding the point of contention on these nets can be
a little more difficult. A net-oriented netlist, such as DUMP.CCF may help.

Since Check Electrical Rules reports problem conditions from a net-oriented
perspective, it will only analyze a net until it reaches the first contention.
You should aim to create schematics that pass Check Electrical Rules without
warnings or errors, so that you are assured of a complete test.

With these points in mind, you should find the Check Electrical Rules reports
less confusing.
