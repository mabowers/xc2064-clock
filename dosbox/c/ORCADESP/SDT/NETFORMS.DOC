This note describes the files used by IFORM and HFORM to create formatted
netlists.  It is provided for your convenience.

The header at the beginning of each uncompiled file contains specific
information about history and correct usage for that particular file.
IFORM and HFORM use netlist format files with the following name conventions:

            |  Even if your version of SPICE does not allow alphabetic node
            |  names, you can still give nodes names if they represent
            |  numerical values (such as '14').  These node 'numbers' will
            |  not overlap with the system defined ones since system node
            |  numbers begin at 10000 (except GND, which is always 0).
            |
            |  Unconnected pins will generate a warning and a space, " ",
            |  will be output instead of a number.  If /I is present, then
            |  unconnected pins will not generate a warning and will be given
            |  a net number starting at 32767 and decreasing with each
            |  additional unconnected pin.
            |
            |  The .MAP file that is generated is only valid if the /N
            |  switch is not used (since labels will be output to the netlist
            |  instead of system created net numbers if /N is present).
