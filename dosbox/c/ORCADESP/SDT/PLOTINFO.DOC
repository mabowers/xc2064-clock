
                       Plotting With OrCAD Plotter Drivers               OrCAD
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This note describes special requirements and techniques for certain plotters
and drivers.  It is provided for your convenience.

OrCAD products use "drivers" to transfer files from the screen to paper.
A driver is a communication media that transfers data between the OrCAD
software and the hardware. OrCAD supports a wide range of plotter drivers.

NOTE:

* New drivers not listed in this note may be found on the OrCAD Bulletin
  Board System (503) 690-9791.
  
  After 24 September 1993, the OrCAD bulletin board phone number will be
  (503) 671-9401. For a period of one year, users calling (503) 690-9791
  will be automatically forwarded to the new bulletin board phone number.

See the OrCAD "Installation and Technical Support User's Guide" for 
information about selected OrCAD drivers.

The remainder of this note describes plotter driver requirements and
techniques.

General notes          |   Be sure you are using the most current version
                       |of the driver. The OrCAD 24-hour Bulletin Board
                       |System (503) 690-9791 is a good source for OrCAD's
                       |latest drivers.
                       |   Read the manual to be sure that you use the
                       |programs as intended. If you have difficulties that
                       |these resources cannot solve, contact one of OrCAD's
                       |Technical Support engineers at (503) 690-9722 
                       |between the hours of 8 AM and 4 PM Pacific Time, or 
                       |you may FAX (503) 690-9891 anytime.

        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Emulation      |   Many plotters have emulation modes in which they
                       |can behave like another plotter model. Consult your
                       |plotter manual for more information about your
                       |plotter's emulation mode. Many common modes are 
                       |listed in this note.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Application    |   Many software programs can read plot files created
        Software       |by OrCAD drivers. Many common formats are listed in 
                       |this note.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Hardware       |   Set up the appropriate hardware settings so that 
        Settings       |your plotter and host system can communicate. Be sure
                       |that your cabling is correct for the hardware used.
                       |Consult your plotter manual.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Rotation       |   OrCAD does not provide for plot rotation. Using
                       |Plot Schematic to create prints, however, will rotate
                       |the schematic for best fit on the printer paper.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Plotter        |   Pen width settings in the OrCAD software indicate
        Pens           |what width of pen is used by the plotter. For
                       |example, when sending a plot to a Hewlett-Packard
                       |Laserjet printer using a printer driver of 300 x 300
                       |dots per inch, specify a pen width of .002 inches,
                       |which is the effective pen width of the printer.
                       |  Some plotters have more than one pen and allow for
                       |pen selection. Most OrCAD drivers support multiple
                       |pens as defined in the appropriate configuration
                       |screen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AutoCad/DXF            |   The plot output files that OrCAD creates must have
(DXF.DRV)              |extensions named ".DXF."  They are then ready for use
                       |by AutoCad's dxfin command. Some application software
                       |may require the file to be processed by AutoCad before
                       |it can be read.
-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------
Calcomp                |   Because Calcomp plotters require direct communica-
(CALCOMP1.DRV)         |tion, it is not possible to plot to a file and then
(CALCOMP2.DRV)         |transfer the file to the plotter.
                       |   Use the cable supplied by Calcomp.
                       |   Some Calcomp plotters, such as the 1023, can
                       |emulate a Hewlett-Packard plotter. See the section in
                       |this note regarding Hewlett-Packard.

Encapsulated Postscript|   The EPS drivers create encapsulated Postscript
EPSF                   |commands used by a variety of application software
(EPS1.DRV)             |packages, such as word processors, and are ready for
(EPS2.DRV)             |transport to a variety of hardware platforms. Most 
(EPS3.DRV)             |often, the EPS files that OrCAD creates need to be
(EPS4.DRV)             |edited before they can be directly processed by the
                       |application software. The necessary modifications can
 [see also Postscript] |range from simply renaming the files to the deletion
                       |and addition of crucial characters in the body of the
                       |files. The specific changes necessary depend on the
                       |application software. For more information, consult
                       |your application software manual.

Hewlett-Packard        |   On larger (C-sized and above) Hewlett-Packard
                       |plotters, the picture origin (0,0) is at the center
HPGL                   |of the picture, while OrCAD's origin is at the top
(HP.DRV)               |left. Offsets need to be introduced into the plot
(HP2.DRV)              |coordinates. These need to be manually set in the
(HPI.DRV)              |configuration menu for the OrCAD product. For example,
(HP2I.DRV)             |Plot Schematic in Schematic Design Tools uses
(HPX.DRV)              |the offsets established in Configure Schematic
                       |Design Tools.
HPGL/2                 |   The offsets need to be a negative value that is
(HPGL-2.DRV)           |one half of the sheet size being plotted. Using the
                       |example just mentioned, the offsets when plotting
                       |a standard C sized schematic need to be "-10.1" and
                       |"-7.6," since the worksheet is 20.2 by 15.2 inches.

                       |about configuration menus.

                       |Most often, these older models cannot draw circles or
                       |arcs. OrCAD does not support these older models.
                       |Hardware upgrades should be available from Hewlett-
                       |Packard.
                       |   A similar situation occurs with some HP-compatible
                       |plotters when they try to plot dashed lines. They
                       |are unable to interpret the HPGL dashed line commands
                       |that OrCAD sends to the plotter. Try using HPX.DRV.
                       |   The HPI and HP2I drivers issue an IN (initialize)
                       |command, rather than the DF (default) command. This
                       |may help when plotting over a network.

Houston Instruments    |   If the plotter plots extra or strange characters,
DMPL                   |you may want to try using HI29.DRV or ZERICON.DRV, 
(HI.DRV)               |which handle end of text commands differently.

Initial Graphics       |   To create a file in the IGES (Initial Graphics
Exchange Specification |Exchange Specification) format, first create a plot
IGES                   |file using the GENERIC.DRV driver. Then run the
(GENERIC.DRV           |Convert Plot To IGES (PLT2IGES.EXE) program on that
    and                |file, creating a destination file. The destination
 PLT2IGES.EXE)         |file will be in the IGES format.

Postscript             |   The PostScript drivers are Plotter drivers, not
(PSCRIPT.DRV)          |Printer drivers. Use Plot Schematic to create the
(PSCRIPT2.DRV)         |plot or plot file. Select a pen width of .003".
