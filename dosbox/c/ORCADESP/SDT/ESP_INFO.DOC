   1. In order to run OrCAD executables from outside of the ESP design 
      environment, you must first add a statement to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
      This statement tells the OrCAD executables which driver to load. If 
      you used a VGA driver, you would add the following statement:

      SET ORCADDD=C:\ORCADESP\DRV\VGA640.DRV

      This assumes that you had installed the default directories onto 
      your C: drive.

   2.  If special video drivers are created using the GENDRIVE utility,
       these drivers will not be displayed in the configuration scroll 
       boxes.  To select your custom driver, delete the existing 
       driver selected and enter the custom driver name.
