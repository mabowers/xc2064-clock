------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This note describes special requirements and techniques for certain printers
and drivers.  It is provided for your convenience.

OrCAD products use "drivers" to transfer files from the screen to paper.
A driver is a communication media that transfers data between the OrCAD
software and the hardware. OrCAD supports a wide range of printer drivers.

NOTE:

* New drivers not listed in this note may be found on the OrCAD Bulletin
  Board System (503) 690-9791.

  After 24 September 1993, the OrCAD bulletin board phone number will be 
  (503) 671-9401. For a period of one year, users calling (503) 690-9791
  will be automatically forwarded to the new bulletin board phone number.

See the OrCAD "Installation and Technical Support User's Guide" for 
information about selected OrCAD drivers.

The remainder of this note describes printer driver requirements and
techniques.

General notes          |   Be sure that you are using the most current
                       |version of the driver. The OrCAD 24-hour Bulletin
                       |Board System (503) 690-9791 is a good source for 
                       |OrCAD's latest drivers.
                       |   Read the manual to be sure that you use the
                       |programs as intended. If you have difficulties that
                       |these resources cannot solve, contact one of OrCAD's
                       |Technical Support engineers, at (503) 690-9722, 
                       |between the hours of 8 AM and 4 PM, Pacific Time, or 
                       |you may fax (503) 690-9891 anytime.

        Scaled         |   The Print Schematic Tool (PRINTALL), prints a quick
        Prints         |rough draft copy of a schematic. For speed, the 
                       |unscaled schematic prints at approximately 100 dots
                       |per inch. If your printer driver is not also 100
                       |dots per inch, the print will not be scaled 1:1. To
                       |create a 1:1 scaled print, use a 100 dpi driver.
                       |    Another way to get a scaled print is to use the
                       |Plot Schematic Tool and specify the printer as the
                       |destination (do this in Plot Schematic - Local
                       |Configuration). This creates a correctly scaled print
                       |without being affected by the resolution of the
                       |printer driver. 
                       |   If some items, such as buses or filled parts,
                       |appear as striped lines rather than solid objects,
                       |you must specify a thinner pen width. The same is 
                       |true when small objects, such as junctions, disappear
                       |from the print. (See "Pen Width" in this note.)
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Rotation       |   Prints are automatically rotated so they will fit
                       |the paper as well as possible. The program first tries
                       |to fit a schematic on the paper in portrait mode
                       |(i.e., X axis on the 8.5" dimension). If it cannot
                       |fit that way, it will rotate to landscape mode
                       |(i.e., X axis on the 11" dimension). If it is still
                       |too large for one sheet, it will rotate to portrait
                       |mode and print the schematic across several pages.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Emulation      |   Many printers have emulation modes in which they
                       |can behave like another printer model. Consult your
                       |printer manual for more information about your
                       |printer's emulation mode.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Hardware       |   Set up the appropriate hardware settings so that 
        Settings       |your printer and host system can communicate. Be sure
                       |that your cabling is correct for the hardware you are
                       |using. Consult your printer manual.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Destination    |  To print from a Print Schematic destination file,
        Files          |copy the file to the printer. Using DOS COPY, you
                       |must use the /B switch to specify that the file being
                       |copied to the printer is a binary file.

        Pen            |   Pen width settings in the OrCAD software indicate
        Width          |what width of pen is being used by a plotter. For
                       |example, when sending a plot to a Hewlett-Packard
                       |Laserjet printer, using a printer driver of 300 x 300
                       |dots per inch, specify a pen width of .002 inches.
                       |This is the effective pen width of the printer.
                       |   If some items, such as buses or filled parts,
                       |appear as striped lines rather than solid objects,
                       |you must specify a thinner pen width. The same is 
                       |true when small objects, such as junctions, disappear
                       |from the print.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Paper          |   Most drivers that support different paper sizes
        Size           |have several renditions of the same driver, each with
                       |different characteristics. An example is the HPLASER
                       |series for the Hewlett-Packard (or compatible) laser-
                       |jet printers:
                       |
                       |    DRIVER      PAPER SIZE     RESOLUTION
                       |
                       |  HPLASER1.DRV  Letter size   75x75  Dots Per Inch
                       |  HPLASER2.DRV  Letter size  100x100 Dots Per Inch
                       |  HPLASER3.DRV  Letter size  150x150 Dots Per Inch
                       |  HPLASER4.DRV  Letter size  300x300 Dots Per Inch
                       |  HPLASER5.DRV  Legal size    75x75  Dots Per Inch
                       |  HPLASER6.DRV  Legal size   100x100 Dots Per Inch
                       |  HPLASER7.DRV  Legal size   150x150 Dots Per Inch
                       |  HPLASER8.DRV  Legal size   300x300 Dots Per Inch
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Color          |   Since print outputs contain no color informa-
        Printers       |tion, OrCAD printer drivers will not work with color
                       |printers. Some third party software companies provide
                       |programs to translate plot files to color printers.
        ---------------+------------------------------------------------------
        Wide           |   All OrCAD programs that output to a printer allow
        Carriage       |the use of wide carriage printers. Consult the manual
        Printers       |for the correct way to configure the specific tool.
-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------
OKIDATA                |   An Okidata printer may need to use an Epson driver
(OKI192.DRV)           |to operate correctly. If the printer uses a 9 pin
(OKI2410.DRV)          |print head, try using the EPSONFX/FX2 or EPSONMX
(OKI92.DRV)            |drivers. If the printer uses a 24 pin print head, try
(EPSON.DRV)            |using The LQ1000 OR LQ1000_2 drivers.
(EPSONFX.DRV)          |
(EPSONFX2.DRV)         |
(EPSONMX.DRV)          |
(EPSONVP.DRV)          |
(LQ1000.DRV)           |
(LQ1000_2.DRV)         |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Postscript             |   The PostScript drivers are Plotter drivers, not
(PSCRIPT.DRV)          |Printer drivers. Use Plot Schematic to create the
(PSCRIPT2.DRV)         |plot or plot file. Configure pen widths to .003".
-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------
Versatec               |   The VERSATEC.DRV driver is a Printer driver, not a
(VERSATEC.DRV)         |Plotter driver. Create a plot with the printer as the
                       |destination device (which will use the currently
                       |configured printer driver).
                       |   VERCABLE.SCH and VERCABLE.LIB describes the cable
                       |used to connect to the Versatec plotter.
