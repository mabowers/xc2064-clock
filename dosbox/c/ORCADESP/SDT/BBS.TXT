     SDT area of the Bulletin Board System.

You can use many but not all bulletin board features.  You immediately have
access to all technical notes, bulletins, and customer-contributed libraries
and software. (file areas 1 through 7 in the figure above).  However, before
accessing the OrCAD products (files areas 8 through 13 above), you must
"officially" register by entering your password and registration number.

The bulletin board system prompts you to enter all the necessary information.
When you successfully answer the prompts, the bulletin board system operator
(SYSOP) receives a message requesting your security level be raised to
"registered user."  It takes two or three working days for the SYSOP to
upgrade your security clearance.

Once your security level is raised to "registered user," you can access
all bulletin board features.  You are encouraged to explore what is
available.


USING 14400 BAUD

The bulletin board system also features 14400 baud with V.42bis and MNP5.
To access at 14400 baud, dial (503) 671-9401.
