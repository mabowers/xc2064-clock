                             IMPORTANT NOTES

1) Be sure to limit your use of the TEMPLATE design to the configuration 
menus. This design is used as a template for the creation of new designs. 
Any files that exist in TEMPLATE are copied to the new design when you select 
Create Design in Design Management tools. Also, any settings in the 
configuration menus are also duplicated in the new design. Keep TEMPLATE free 
of any extra files such as schematics. When you are ready to begin using the 
ESP design environment for the first time, create a new design or use the 
TUTOR design.

2)  In order to run OrCAD executables from outside of the ESP design 
environment, you must first add a statement to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This 
statement tells the OrCAD executables which driver to load. For example, if 
you used a VGA driver, you would add the following statement: 

                SET ORCADDD=C:\ORCADESP\DRV\VGA640.DRV

The example above assumes that you had installed the default directories 
onto your C: drive.

3) The different ground symbols in DEVICE.LIB all use the same 
pin name:"GND." This means that if you wish to use the different symbols in 
a design, you will need to make custom copies of the ground symbols that have 
different pin names. See OrCAD's "Schematic Design Tools Reference Guide," 
Chapter 17: Edit Library, for more information. If you do not customize these 
generic parts, you will find that they short together in a netlist.

4)  If you wish M2EDIT (the default text editor) to place the cursor at the
location of warnings and errors in the output file, add a /E in the Text
Editor option in the Configure ESP menu. Example: 

                C:\ORCADEXE\M2EDIT.EXE /E

5)  If you should encounter any problems, be sure to check your disks for 
information files. Read the sections in your manuals that pertain to the
particular problem. In addition, check the View Reference area in the 
ESP design environment for additional helpful files. The OrCAD Bulletin Board 
System is another good source of help.

    The current OrCAD bulletin board phone number is (503) 690-9791. After
24 September 1993, the OrCAD bulletin board phone number will be 
(503) 671-9401. For a period of one year, users calling (503) 690-9791 will 
be automatically forwarded to the new bulletin board phone number.
