 WELCOME TO THE XILINX INSTALL V5.0.0 MAY 1994  
===============================================

This README file gives a brief explanation of the
temporary directory \xinstall created by the Xilinx
Installation Program. 

The directory \xinstall has been created to hold
temporary files used by the Xilinx installation 
program.  This directory also stores other files
that may be helpful to the user. 

Description of the files left behind by the installation program: 

============
AUTOEXEC.XLX
============

This text file contains a log of the Xilinx products installed
during an installation session.  New information is always
appended to this file so the latest information can be found
at the end of the file.  Please be aware that this file can
become large in size.  This file is left in the root directory.

This file can be removed if the user no longer needs the 
given information.

=========
/AUTOSAVE
=========

This directory is created to store the backup AUTOEXEC.BAT files which are 
numbered auto1.bat, auto2.bat, etc.  This directory is a subdirectory of
the /xinstall directory. 

This directory and its files can be removed if the user no longer needs the
given information.

==========
SERIAL.NOS
==========

This text file contains the serial number information stored 
by the installation program, but it will not be created if the 
installation was not successful.  This file can be used to reference
the serial numbers for your Xilinx products.  This file is left
in the /xinstall directory. 

This file should not be removed.

==========
SERIAL.BAT
==========

This batch file will display the information stored in serial.nos.
This file is left in the /xinstall directory.

This file should not be removed.

========
/REPORTS
========

This directory is created to store installation status information of
a product.  This directory is only created if the user chose to have
this information saved during the installation or if an error occurred
when reading media (no other error messages will be stored here). 
A subdirectory is created for each installed product and is given
the name of the installed product.  This directory is a subdirectory
of the /xinstall directory.

This directory and its subdirectories can be removed if the user no
longer needs the given information.


===========
UP2DATE.LST
===========

This text file is created by the install program only if it was detected
that newer files exist on your destination path than those found on your
installation media.  The file contains the list of those newer files. This
file is left in the /xinstall directory.

This file can be removed if the user no longer needs the given information.
