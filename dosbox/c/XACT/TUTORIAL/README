# This table describes tutorial or example designs available under this
#   directory.  It is automatically updated by the Xilinx Install program
#   using the file.des file in each design directory.
# Each design is located in the directory <Interface>/<Design>.
# The Family entry indicates which Xilinx product families are supported by
#   the design.
# If ABL is marked, the design contains Xilinx ABEL logic blocks
# If BLX is marked, the design contains X-BLOX components
# If PAL is marked, the design contains PAL components
# If SYN is marked, the design contains synthesized logic other than Xilinx ABEL
# If PRF is marked, the design demonstrates XACT-Performance timing specs
# Most Interface directories are self-explanatory.  The behavior directory
#   contains behavioral designs that are independent of interface.
