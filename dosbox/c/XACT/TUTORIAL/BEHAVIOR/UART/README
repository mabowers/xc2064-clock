GENERAL INFORMATION:

Design:         UART
Req'd software: XEPLD v5.0
                XABEL v5.0 (optional)
Platforms:      PC-DOS, Sun, HP700
Target device:  XC7354-68 or larger (any speed)

The UART tutorial demonstrates the conversion of an existing PAL-based design 
into a single EPLD device. The original design of a UART receiver consists of 
4 PAL devices (three 22V10's and one GAL20V8). The PAL logic is defined using 
4 ABEL equation files: cntr6.abl, datareg.abl, rcvr.abl and shifter.abl. PALASM 
versions of the 4 PAL files are also provided (*.pld) if you are not using the 
XABEL compiler.

The 4 ABEL files are first translated to PLUSASM using the XABEL compiler. You 
can compile the files under the XABEL interface, which can be invoked by 
selecting DesignEntry -> XABEL in the XDM menu. You can also invoke the 
ABEL-to-PLUSASM translator by entering the following commands:

  abl2pld -p 7354 cntr6
  abl2pld -p 7354 datareg
  abl2pld -p 7354 rcvr
  abl2pld -p 7354 shifter

After converting the 4 ABEL files into PLUSASM, they are read into the XEPLD 
software using the PALCONVT command as follows:

  1. In XDM, select Fitter -> PALCONVT.
  2. Type "uart" as the new design name.
  3. Select cntr6.pld, datareg.pld, rcvr.pld and shifter.pld from the list of 
     PAL files.
  4. Select "Done"
  5. Select "Create new PLD and PAL Interconnect Report".

The PALCONVT command creates an Interconnect report, uart.int, listing all the 
signals used by each of the PALs and how they were interpreted. PALCONVT also 
generates a top-level PLUSASM design file, uart.pld, representing the 
integrated EPLD design. The uart.pld file names the 4 equation files to be 
included in the design and lists the names of all the signals used in the 
design. You would normally edit the uart.pld file to supply information about 
which signals you want to appear on pins of the EPLD device (this information 
is not conveyed by the original PAL equation files). A completed version of the 
top-level design file is provided, named uartdemo.pld. 

To run the completed design contained in uartdemo.pld through the EPLD fitter, 
select Fitter -> FITEQN in the XDM menu, or enter the following command:

  fiteqn -e uartdemo -p 7354-10pc68

The fitter produces several report files, including Resources (.res), Mapping 
(.map), Pinlist (.pin) and Partitioning (.par), all provided in this directory 
as examples (uart.*).
