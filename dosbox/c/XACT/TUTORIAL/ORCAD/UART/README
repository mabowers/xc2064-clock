The UART tutorial demonstrates a typical EPLD schematic design flow.
The logic of a UART receiver is expressed by an OrCAD schematic containing 
standard library components and a PAL22V10. The PAL logic is defined using 
an ABEL equation file, rcvr.abl. A PALASM version of the PAL file is also 
provided (rcvr.pld) if you are not using the XABEL compiler. (For a 
completely schematic-based version of the UART design, see the UARTTOP 
tutorial.)

DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION FLOW:

The ABEL equation file is first translated to PLUSASM using the XABEL compiler. 
You can compile the files under the XABEL interface, which can be invoked by 
selecting DesignEntry -> XABEL in the XDM menu. You can also invoke the 
ABEL-to-PLUSASM translator by entering the following command:

  abl2pld -p 7354 rcvr

The UART schematic is then converted into an xnf netlist and read into the 
XEPLD software using the XEMAKE command as follows:

  1. In XDM, select Translate -> XEMAKE.
  2. Select Done when options are listed.
  3. Select "uart.sch" from the list of design names.
  4. Select "Make design database" as the target.

XEMAKE automatically invokes the SDT interface, which generates the xnf 
netlist file. It then invokes the EPLD fitter (FITNET) to implement the 
design. The fitter generates a design database file (uart.vmh) representing 
the implemented design. The fitter produces several report files, including 
Resources (.res), Mapping (.map), Pinlist (.pin), and Partitioning (.par), all 
provided in this directory as examples (uart.*).

DESIGN VERIFICATION FLOW:

The UART tutorial directory contains OrCAD VST stimulus and trace files for 
running timing simulation on the UART design after it is implemented. A timing 
simulation netlist is generated from the design database using the XSIMMAKE 
command as follows:

  1. In XDM, select Verify -> XSIMMAKE.
  2. Select the "-F" option and select "Orcad_EPLD_Timing"; then select Done.
  3. Select uart.vmh from the list of design names.

XSIMMAKE generates an OrCAD simulation netlist, uart.vst. You can now invoke 
the OrCAD VST simulator and apply the uart.stm (stimulus) and uart.trc (trace) 
files. Be sure to specify uart.vst as the name of the connectivity database in 
your VST configuration. To view the simulation results:

  1. In VST, select Trace -> Change View and enter 1100.
  2. Select Run Simulation and enter 110000 as the simulation length.

DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE:

A complete description of the UART design tutorial is provided in the XEPLD 
OrCAD Tutorial chapter of the Xilinx OrCAD Interface User Guide.
