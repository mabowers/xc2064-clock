GENERAL INFORMATION:

Design:              UARTTOP
Compatible software: OrCAD SDT 386+ and VST 386+ (OrCAD IV is not compatible)
                     XEPLD fitter from XACT v5.0
                     Xilinx OrCAD Interface v5.0

Platform:            PC
Target device:       XC7354-68 or larger (any speed)

The UARTTOP tutorial demonstrates a purely schematic-based EPLD design flow.
The logic of a UART receiver is expressed by a hierarchical OrCAD schematic. 
The UARTTOP schematic contains a sheet symbol representing the control logic 
defined in the RCVRSUB schematic. (The UARTTOP design contains the same logic 
as the PAL-based UART design.)

FUNCTIONAL SIMULATION FLOW:

The UARTTOP tutorial directory contains OrCAD VST stimulus and trace files for 
running functional simulation on the UARTTOP design before it is implemented. 
A functional simulation netlist is generated from the UARTTOP and RCVRSUB 
schematics using the XSIMMAKE command as follows:

  1. In XDM, select Verify -> XSIMMAKE.
  2. Select the "-F" option and select "Orcad_EPLD_Func"; then Done.
  3. Select uarttop.sch from the list of design names.

XSIMMAKE generates an OrCAD simulation netlist, uarttop.vst. You can now invoke 
the OrCAD VST simulator and apply the uarttop.stm (stimulus) and uarttop.trc 
(trace) files. Be sure to specify uarttop.vst as the name of the connectivity 
database in your VST configuration. To view the simulation results:

  1. In VST, select Trace -> Change View and enter 1100.
  2. Select Run Simulation and enter 110000 as the simulation length.

DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION FLOW:

The UARTTOP schematic is converted into an xnf netlist and read into the 
XEPLD software using the XEMAKE command as follows:

  1. In XDM, select Translate -> XEMAKE.
  2. Select Done when options are listed.
  3. Select "uarttop.sch" from the list of design names.
  4. Select "Make design database" as the target.

XEMAKE automatically invokes the SDT interface, which generates the xnf 
netlist file. It then invokes the EPLD fitter (FITNET) to implement the 
design. The fitter generates a design database file (uarttop.vmh) representing 
the implemented design. The fitter produces several report files, including 
Resources (.res), Mapping (.map), Pinlist (.pin), and Partitioning (.par), all 
provided in this directory as examples (uarttop.*). You can now proceed with 
timing simulation of the implemented design using the same procedure as 
described for the UART tutorial design.

DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE:

A complete description of the UARTTOP design tutorial is provided in Session 6 
of the XEPLD OrCAD Tutorial chapter of the Xilinx OrCAD Interface User Guide.
