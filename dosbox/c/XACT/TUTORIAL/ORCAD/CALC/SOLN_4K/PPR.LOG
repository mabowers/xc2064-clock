    *** PPR: WARNING 7034: 
          In categories of paths that have NO timing specifications, the design 
          has 34 path end-point pairs.  Note that there may be multiple paths
          between any listed pair of end-points.  To limit the number of paths
          reported in each category, set PPR parameter show_tsi_paths =
          <value>.   
    The end-point pairs are listed in file calc.tsi. To suppress the listing
    of paths for categories with no timing specifications, set PPR parameter
    tsi_show_all=FALSE.

    *** PPR: WARNING 7028: 
          The design has flip-flops with asynchronous set/reset controls
          (PRE/SD or CLR/RD pins).  When PPR analyzes design timing, it does
          not trace paths through the asynchronous set/reset input and on
          through the Q output.
          
          If you want PPR to control the delay on paths through asynchronous
          set/reset pins, you must split the delay requirement into two
          segments: one ending at the set/reset input, and the other beginning
          at the flip-flop output.
          If you want PPR not to analyze paths that lead to asynchronous
          set/reset pins, attach an IGNORE specification to the pin(s) or
          signal(s).
          
          By default, XDelay reports all paths through asynchronous set/reset
          pins. To prevent XDelay from showing these paths, use FlagBlk
          CLB_Disable_SR_Q on the appropriate flip-flops. 

    *** PPR: WARNING 7029: 
          The design has RAM elements.  When PPR analyzes design timing, it
          does not trace paths through the data or write-enable inputs and on
          through the RAM output.  Such paths are normally of interest only
          when the RAM is being read during a write operation.
          
          If you want PPR to control the delay on paths through the D or WE
          inputs, you must split the delay requirement into two segments: one
          ending at the RAM input pin, and the other beginning at the RAM
          output.
          
          By default, XDelay does not report paths through D or WE pins either. 
          To allow XDelay to show these paths, use FlagBlk CLB_Enable_WE and/or 
          FlagBlk CLB_Enable_DIN on the appropriate RAMs.
