    Chip Pinout Description
    ----------------------- 
    
    This chapter describes where your design's pins were placed in terms
    of the package pins.  This first list is sorted by package pin
    location.  The second list presents the same data sorted by your
    design's pin names.

    This list describes where your design's pins are in terms of the
    package pins; it is sorted by your design's pin name.  The list
    presented above has the same data sorted by package pin location.

    Split Nets
    ------------------- 
    The list below identifies those signals which were routed through
    CLBs or other blocks. In XDE and XDelay reports, these signals will
    have two or more segments. An underscore (_) and a number will be
    added to the end of the original signal name to identify the
    different segments. To analyze all segments of a signal in XDelay or
    QueryNet reports, append the original name with "_*" when prompted
    for a signal name. 
    
    PPR may route signals through CLBs or other blocks in any of the 
    following situations: 
    
    * The delay on a signal might be reduced by routing it through a CLB, 
    given the extra flexibility in routing resources and the reduced 
    capacitive loading on the signal. PPR takes this into consideration. 
    
    * The delay on a signal might be reduced by sourcing it from two
    block outputs instead of one, which is possible in some block
    configurations. PPR will do this where possible. 
    
    * A signal on a global buffer may not be able to connect directly to 
    a load pin, given the placement of that load pin and the other global 
    resources which are used. PPR will pass the signal through another 
    CLB and route the load pin using general-purpose interconnect. 
    
    * In an XC4000 design, A BUFGP can be sourced only from an IOB. If 
    the design indicates that a BUFGP is driven from an internal source, 
    PPR will route the signal through the output path of the IOB in order
    to access the BUFGP input.
