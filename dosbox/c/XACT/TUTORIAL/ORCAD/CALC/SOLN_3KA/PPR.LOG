    *** PPR: WARNING 6811: 
          This design has 1 purely combinational loop.  Such loops should be
          avoided.  If at all possible, please modify the design to eliminate 
          all unclocked feedback paths. 
          
          To permit path analysis during design implementation, all loops will
          be broken by cutting out the last source-to-load connection. A
          consequence is that the analyzer will not account for ANY paths
          through that connection.  This may cause the final performance of
          your design to be sub-optimal. 
          
          You can instruct the path analyzer to cut out connections of your
          choice, by using timespec "ignore" attributes.  For details, consult
          the PPR documentation. 
    A loop of 1 source-to-load connections: 
      FG4 FG_OSC_3K/Q          (Net OSC_3K/Q) to 
    first gate again.
    

    *** PPR: WARNING 7035: 
          To suppress the listing of paths for categories with no timing 
          specifications, set PPR parameter tsi_show_all=FALSE.

    *** PPR: WARNING 7028: 
          The design has flip-flops with asynchronous set/reset controls
          (PRE/SD or CLR/RD pins).  When PPR analyzes design timing, it does
          not trace paths through the asynchronous set/reset input and on
          through the Q output.
          
          If you want PPR to control the delay on paths through asynchronous
          set/reset pins, you must split the delay requirement into two
          segments: one ending at the set/reset input, and the other beginning
          at the flip-flop output.
          If you want PPR not to analyze paths that lead to asynchronous
          set/reset pins, attach an IGNORE specification to the pin(s) or
          signal(s).
          
          By default, XDelay reports all paths through asynchronous set/reset
          pins. To prevent XDelay from showing these paths, use FlagBlk
          CLB_Disable_SR_Q on the appropriate flip-flops.
