2022: The Xilinx EPLD system must make a directory '%s%s%s' to
      store the component database. But, a file of the same name already
      exists. Please rename this file and try again.
2023: XEMAKE: The xnf translator programs were specified with the option to
      place their output in directory '%s%s%s'. But, a file of
      the same name already exists. Please rename this file and try again.

      run XEMAKE, FITEQN or FITNET. Also, verify that this file has
      read access. Otherwise, use another design database.

      if there is read access to files and subdirectories, 
      or if there is some other hardware failure.
2028: Component was not created.
2029: The schematic '%s' is missing or can not be read.
      Verify that the file exists and has read access.
2030: The behavioral file '%s' can not be read.
      Verify that the file exists and has read access. Then, retry.
2031: The options supplied are incomplete or can not be used together.
      Supply the proper option(s) according to the following usage:

      Verify that the file exists and has read access. 
2033: The makefile '%s' can not be created by XEMAKE.
      Verify that there is sufficient disk space and that your files 
      have write access.
2034: The makefile '%s' is missing or can not be read by XEMAKE. 
      Verify that the makefile exists and has read access, supply a new
      makefile, or create another makefile by running XEMAKE with 
      the -g option.
2035: The file '%s', which is needed to build '%s', is missing
      or can not be read by XEMAKE. Verify that this file exists and has
      read access. 
2036: Orcad designs (*.sch) are meant for integration 
      on DOS only. Specify another schematic or run XEPLD on a PC.
2037: The behavioral file '%s' is missing or can not be read.
      Verify that this file exists and has read access. If this was originally
      a JEDEC file, run JED2PLD. If originally an XABEL file, run ABL2PLD.
      Otherwise, use another behavioral file and retry.
2038: The target file '%s' is not in the current 
      makefile '%s'. Select the proper target file.
2039: %s 
      Makefile syntax error: missing colon. The correct syntax is:
      <target> : <dependent_file1> <dependent_file2> ...
      Run XEMAKE -g to create the proper makefile.
2040: The -p and -f options for pin assignment and pin freezing
      can not be used together. Choose either one only.
2041: The makefile '%s' is empty or only has comments (ignored).
      Run XEMAKE with the -g option to create a correct makefile. 
2042: %s
      Makefile syntax error: The makefile can not have a target file as 
      a dependent file also. Run XEMAKE -g to create the proper makefile.
2043: %s
      Makefile syntax error: This line must specify at least one
      dependent file according to the following syntax: 
      <target> : <dependent_file1> <dependent_file2> ...
      Run XEMAKE -g to create the proper makefile.
2044: %s
      Makefile syntax error: Only alphanumeric characters are allowed
      for this line. The correct syntax is: 
      <target> : <dependent_file1> <dependent_file2> ...
      Run XEMAKE -g to create the proper makefile.
2045: Makefile syntax error: no command after a dependency statement.
      The correct syntax is:
      <target> : <dependent_file1> <dependent_file2> ...
                 <command1>
                 <commandn>
      Run XEMAKE -g to create the proper makefile.
2046: The FITNET or FITEQN commands are not in the makefile '%s'. 
      Run XEMAKE -g to create a correct makefile.
2047: PAL component list '%s' does not exist. Verify that this
      file is in your directory and has read access before executing PALCONVT.
2048: Bad library option '%d'. The valid values are: '-l 4' to use 
      the old XEPLD 4.x library or '-l 5' to use the new unified library. 
2049: The xnf file '%s.xnf' is missing or can not be read by XEMAKE.
      Verify that this file exists and has read access.
2050: The output simulation xnf filename '%s.%s' can not be 
      the same as the schematic xnf file. 
2051: You must append a filename to '@' (i.e., @palfiles.txt). This 
      filename should contain a list of all PAL files for PALCONVT to process. 
2052: The new PLD file has not been specified.
2053: No PAL files were specified. Specify these individual PAL files.
2054: The '%s' netlist was not created because of errors.
