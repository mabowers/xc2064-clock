0068:Toggle flops are available only on the 7336. The partitioner cannot 
     convert equation %s which uses toggle and export into a 
     sum-of-products equation.  Construct equations without using both 
     toggle and export.  
0069:Equation '%s' must be inverted since this device supports only
       active-low polarity for fast outputs.  This equation uses export

0110:Using '%s' as the maximum number of shared pterms before 
     splitting an internal output!

     placed there because they are converted to uim nodes:
     %s 
0116:Equation '%s' is being formed using the hardware T Flip-Flop.
0117:Equation '%s' converted to sum-of-products format.
     Fast function blocks cannot support .D1/.D2 equations directly.      
0118:The following node(s) were inverted to give them the capability to be

     unaffected. The names of the inverted nodes have been 
     appended with '%s': 
     %s

0119:The following node(s) were inverted because they were assigned to 
     fast function blocks and required fewer pterms when inverted. The
     logic appearing on external pins in unaffected.  The names of the 
     inverted nodes have been appended with '%s': 
     %s

0200:1:Additional time delay introduced by splitting external output '%s'!
0202:1:Equation '%s' starts a partition & uses .ADD!
     It will accept a carry-in from whatever gets mapped before it.
     To specify multi-fb arithmetic use a partition statement of more
     than 9 equations.
0203:1:Partition name '%s' starts with 'FB' but not recognized as a
     physical assignment name.  Treating it as a logical partition.
     To avoid this warning, use a different name!
0204:Attempting to implement '%s.T' using the XOR of the alu function. 
     Currently, only the XC7336 supports toggle-flops directly.
0205:1:The partitioner cannot place node '%s' in the uim
     because of polarity restrictions on the following input(s):
     %s 
     Node '%s' will be placed in a macrocell instead. 
     Additional time delay introduced.
0206:1:Unable to split node '%s'. It contains too many inputs 
     for one product term.  Attempting to form the node using the 
     'UIM &' capability. 
0207:1:Equation '%s' has NOT been placed in a fast function block; 
     it can not utilize the fast input path. This equation will use the UIM
     version of all fast inputs fanning into it.  Place this equation in a fast 
     function block if you want it to use the fast inputs version of its fanins.
0208:1:Additional time delay introduced by splitting tristated equation '%s'!
0209:1:Equation '%s' assigned to both '%s' and '%s'!
     There is a conflict between pin assignments and/or partition statements
     and/or control signal assignments that is assigning the same equation
     to different function blocks.
