     This equation will increase the collapser and minimizer runtime and

     your logic into multiple equations.
0463:The pin list must begin directly after the pldtype in the CHIP statement!

0467:1:The PINTRST statement is no longer supported and is being ignored.
     Pin-tristated outputs are now default.
     To tristate internal feedbacks, use the new syntax NODETRST.
     To run old designs with old PINTRST syntax, add this line to
     the 'xepld.cfg' config file:
         ( alias NODETRST  ON ) 
  
0468:1:NODETRST is overridden by ( alias NODETRST ON ) found in

  statements !
0471:1:Tristate set to ground ! It will permanently disable the signal.
0472:1:The design has tristated equation output(s) which are not 
     declared with 'NODETRST'. These equation outputs will be treated
     as if they where declared with 'NODETRST' since the target device
     supports only 'NODETRST'.
0473:Pin '%s' is used as a fast input. Fast inputs are not supported
     on the current device!
0474:Running out of memory in the lower 640KB conventional memory area.
     Try again after removing TSRs, network drivers, etc.
     If called from XEMAKE, choose instead commands FITEQN and MAKEPRG, which
     use less of the 640KB memory area.
     Use the EMM386 program to move TSRs, drivers, etc. to the upper memory
     area may also help. See the MS-DOS manual.
0475:Pin '%s' uses pad latch or pad register.
     Not allowed for the target device!
0476:Equation output '%s' using arithmetic mode must be in 
     a PARTITION statement defining order relative other equation outputs.
