0010:Too many fast clocks required, there are only %d available\
     on %s.
0011:The design requires too many FastClocks used as macrocell\
     clocks; there are only %d available.
0012:Too many fast clocks used in input registers, only %d can\
     be used to clock input registers.

     be implemented in Fast Function Block as specified/required.\
     Consider using macrocell driving FastClock pin or moving\
     signal to High-Density Function Block.

     In\
          x.clkf = clk and y = clk ...,\
     consider declaring a second input pin clk1 and tie it to\
     clk externally, then change y to\

     this device.  Consider moving signals clocked by this clock\
     to a High-Density Function Block.

     FastClock.  Consider using macrocell driving FastClock pin.

     be implemented in Fast Function Block as specified/required.\
     Consider moving signal to High-Density Function Block.
0030:TRST '%s' cannot be converted to FOE since it is used\
     to tristate the nodetrst output '%s'.

0040:Signal '%s' assigned to FastClock pin '%s' not used\
