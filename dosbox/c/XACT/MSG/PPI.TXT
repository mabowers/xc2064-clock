0000:PPI information messages -------------------------------------
0001: Net %s does not have a sink. Net is ignored.
0002: Net %s does not have a source. Net is ignored.
0003: Net %s is empty. Net is ignored.
# 0004:instance: %s type:%s[cid=%d]
0004:instance: %s type:%s
0005:instance: %s type:%s: COMPONENT IS NOT FOUND IN A LIBRARY
0006:Created an input port to connect %s...
0007:Created an output port to connect %s...
0008:Created a bi-directional port to connect %s...
0009:Non-Xilinx EPLD port detected (name=%s type=%s)
0010:Pin '%s:%s' is tristated and driving an OBUF(E). The tristate

#
1000:PPI warning messages -----------------------------------------
# 1001:NULL component name parameter given to ppi_load_component!
1001: [Internal Error - NULL parameter].
1002:Created a bi-directional port to connect %s...
1003:Created an input port to connect %s...
1004:Created an output port to connect %s...
1005:Pad buffer '%s' is unconnected. It is removed !
1006:Property '%s' is unrecognized and will be ignored.
Actual results may differ from your intended results. Check spelling
or specify another XEPLD-supported schematic property after integration.
1007:Property '%s' is unsupported for this chip and will be ignored.
1008:Netlist file '%s' 
   looks like a simulation netlist file !
   Regenerate the netlist from the schematic if this is the case.
#
2000:PPI error messages -------------------------------------------
2001:Invalid Parameter.
2002:No INPUT Port Component.
2003:No IO Port Component.
2004:No OUTPUT Port Component.
2005:No DESIGN found.
2006:No INSTANCES found.
2007:No COMPONENTS found.
2008:No NETS found.
     Your schematic capture tool probably generated an unsupported format.
     This can happen:
        a) if you have the wrong schematic capture tool selected
        b) if you use strange characters within label names
        c) if you use an unsupported version of a schematic capture tool
2009:Invalid Port Direction.
2010:Port Not Found.
# 2011:USR Array Not Allocated
2011: [Internal Error - may be out of memory].
# 2012:PPI Not Enough Memory
2012: Not Enough Memory.
#
2013:[Internal Error: No OUTPUT pin found on input port %s].
2014:[Internal Error - Invalid INPUT port component].
2015:[Internal Error: Cannot create INPUT port instance].
2016:[Internal error: No INPUT pin found on output port %s]
2018:[Internal Error: Cannot create OUTPUT port instance].
2017:[Internal error: Invalid OUTPUT port component].
2019:[Internal Error: No OUTPUT pin found on i/o port %s].
2020:[Internal error: No INPUT pin found on i/o port %s].
2021:[Internal Error: Invalid I/O port component].
2022:[Internal error: Cannot create I/O port instance].
#
2023:Out Of Memory.
2024:[Internal Error: Cannot OPEN COMPONENT DATABASE].
2025:Cannot FLATTEN Component!
# 2026:Cannot get current file handle!	
2026: [Internal error in file processing].
2027:[Internal Error - No FILENAME supplied].
# 2028:No USER Environment space!
2028: [Internal Error - may be out of memory].		
2029:Cannot find PLD '%s'! Make sure the component is assembled!
2030:No FAST CLOCK Port Component
2031:Invalid netlist file! (syntax error or incomplete or nonexistent)
     Your schematic capture tool generated some unsupported syntax.
     This can happen:
        a) for Workview if you have a library alias in your viewdraw.ini
        b) if you use strange characters within label names
        c) if you use an unsupported version of a schematic capture tool
2032:This component %s is not supported for this chip!
2033:There is a '%s' -component missing property PLD!
2034:Xnf-reader: %s
2035:Cannot open input netlist file '%s'!
2036:Cannot find the BUF component in the component library !
    Make sure that the component library is installed in the correct directory.
2037:Current schematic design has no external pad connections !
2038:Component '%s' is directly connected to an External Pad !
    Only i/o buffer components may connect to External Pads.
2039: Netlist file '%s'
is not in a proper XNF format. It does not start with a LCANET version record !
2040: The instance '%s' of component type '%s' is not supported or
      the netlist was not generated with the XC7000 library.
2041: There are multiple output buffers connected to net '%s'.
      Only 1 output buffer is allowed.
2042: There are multiple input buffers connected to net '%s'. 
      There may only be at most 2 buffers: an IBUF used with an IFD,
      IFDX1 or ILD component.
2043: The input buffers connected to net '%s' can not be used together.
      The only valid combination of input buffers is an IBUF used with an
      IFD, IFDX1 or ILD component.
2044: Illegal connection between VCC and output buffer '%s'. 
      Insert a BUF component to generate a constant-driven output pin.
2045: Illegal connection between GND and output buffer '%s'.
      Insert a BUF component to generate a constant-driven output pin.
2046: The pulldown instance '%s' is not allowed in the XC7000 family.
      Use another component.
2047: Input buffer '%s' directly connects to output buffer '%s'.
      A BUF component must be inserted between these buffers
      to form a direct pin-to-pin data path.
2048: The external net '%s' is driving the output buffer '%s'.
      This net is coming from an output pad. Either replace this output pad
      with an input pad or replace this output buffer with an input buffer.
2049: The input buffer '%s' is driving the external net '%s'.
      This net is going to an input pad. Either replace this input pad
      with an output pad or replace this input buffer with an output buffer.
2050: Non-arithmetic-carry pin %s%s%s is connected to a carry net.
2051: The net '%s' is driving multiple output buffers. Components may
      drive one output buffer/output pad connection only. Eliminate all but
      one of the output buffers from this net.
2052: Pad buffer: %s type: %s MUST be connected to a pad symbol.
