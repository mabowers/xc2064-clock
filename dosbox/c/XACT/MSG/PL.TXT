0087:Attempt to invert output '%s'of fast comparator component '%s'. (internal error)!
0088:Given term id %d and term type %d are inconsistent. (internal error!)

0090:Attempt to invert output of fast comparator %s. 
0091:In component '%s' non-clock pin '%s' routed to fast clock driver.
0092:%d fast clocks in a schematic. Only %d are allowed.
0093:Invalid fast clock distribution. 
0094:Can't find bitmap. (internal error)!
0095:Attempt to place fast clock driver '%s' in fast clock 2. 
0096:Fast clock is not placed.
0097:Cannot map fastclock because only one of pins 10 and 11 can drive a pad
0098:Run out of id's for fast clock signals. Increase the range. (internal error!)
0099:Run out of id's for common signals. Increase the range. (internal error!)
0100:More  macrocells in FB then bits in int field. (internal error)!

0107:Invalid clock state is asked. (internal error)!
0108:Invalid shift state is asked. (internal error)!
0109:Output '%s' of instance '%s' has a permanent LOW.
0110:Output '%s' of instance '%s' has a permanent HIGH.
0111:Component '%s' does not drive anything and it is removed.
0112:Port '%s' removed because it has no logic connection!
0113:Port '%s' moved from assigned pin '%s' to pin '%s'.
0114:Fast compare component '%s' has not been mapped
     Please check the following:
       a) you have not used more than 2 fastcompare units
       b) if you used manual pin assignment (in a schematic)
          i) you specified the dedicated input data pins (79-84,2-7)
          ii) you specified the dedicated output pins (76,77)
          iii) you assigned the data input pins in ascending pin order
               (i.e., I0 to PIN79 and I11 to PIN7)
       c) if you used a pin-save file
          i) you specified the dedicated input data pins (79-84,2-7)
          ii) you specified the dedicated output pins (76,77)

0115:Cannot divide component '%s' because it uses arithmetic carry (or shift)
     To understand why the mapper could not map it, check the following:
       a) you need an empty FB with enough macrocells to hold the component
       b) the FB needs enough chip output & I/O pins attached to match the
          component's external output & I/O requirements
       c) if you used manual pin assignment (in a schematic) or
	  used a pin-save file
          i) you assigned the data output & I/O pins in descending pin order
               (e.g., comp-pin 22 to chip-pin 63,comp-pin 23 to chip-pin 62)
          ii) you assigned the external output and I/O pins to chip-pins
              that correspond to the FB's chip pins

0116:Cannot remove unconnected output '%s' of '%s' because it uses Add/shift.
   If you don't need this output to propagate carry/shift to another component
   & you wish remove it: tie it and other high-order outputs to power or ground.
0117:Instance pin (%s:%s) has a UIM feedback path (instead of 
    fast feedback) because it's feedback drives an AND operation in the UIM.
0118:Default power setting of '%s' on instance '%s' contradicts
    previous default. Using this new default value.
0119:Invalid value, '%s' for the POWERDEFAULT property on instance '%s'.
    Use HIGH or LOW!
0120:Invalid value, '%s' for the POWER property on instance '%s'.
    Use HIGH or LOW!
0121:Schematic power control value of '%s' on instance '%s'
    over-rides the power settings in the equations!
0122:Power control for instance '%s' ignored because instance was optimized. 
0123:Cannot place physical partition '%s' with outputs in
     the specified order.  Trying to place them with re-ordering.
0124:No carry-out connection into component '%s' using carry-in!
0125:Incorrect carry from '%s'(FB%d-%d) to '%s'(FB%d-%d)!
    You must control the mapping so that hardware-carry components map
    in carry-chain order (e.g., FB4-1 ... FB4-9 to FB3-1 ... FB3-9).
0126:Internal Error. Cannot place %s %s at mc-%d!
