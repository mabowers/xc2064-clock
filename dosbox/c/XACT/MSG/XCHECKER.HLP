.INDEX command

    !<command_number>
	  Execute a previously entered command. Similar to the UNIX
	  convention. Use the 'history' command to display command
	  history. 

    alias name definition
    	  Allows commands to be aliased to user defined names.

    < batchname     
    or
    batch batchname
	  Execute commands from a file, the file must have a .CMD extension.

    browse filename
	  Browse or view a text file on PC platforms.

    baud baud_rate
	  Change the communication baud rate between the host system and
	  XChecker or the serial download cable. If no baud rate is specified
	  the current baud rate is displayed.

    break
	  Stop the free-running clock on XChecker's CLKO pin.  This is the
	  same command as 'clock -stop'.

    clock [-stop|-resume] [-int|-ext -speed 1|3|5|11] nclocks
	  Specify the origin, speed, and number of clocks generated on
	  XChecker's CLKO pin. With no arguments, the current settings are
	  displayed.

    diag [-p] number [-np]
	  Run the XChecker diagnostics test; the supplied test fixture
	  must be plugged into XChecker's socket.  The option 'number'
	  specifies the number of times to execute the diagnostics test.
	  The -p option pauses before executing the test, the -np option
	  supresses the pause.

#    dump [ -bin | -oct | -dec | -hex ] [ -s start_addr ] [ -l number_of_bits ]
#	  Dumps data captured from the last readback snapshot or 
#	  verify command. 

    display [-clear -all -add|-delete] [-bin|-oct|-dec|-hex] [*|signal_list]
	  Setup displayed format for the signal list. The signals
	  defined in this display list are a subset of the signals
	  defined in probe list.  This command is the same as the 'pick'
	  command.

    exit [-nsave]
	  Exits the current XChecker session. Also used to exit
	  the current command shell and return to the XChecker session,
	  if at a system prompt originally started by XChecker's 'sys' command.
	  The -nsave option exits the program without saving the profile
	  in the 'xchecker.pro' file.

    export [-v|-viewlogic] save_file
	  Saves the current readback data to the file save_file.
	  Default save_file format is XChecker binary format.
	  With the -v or -viewlogic option, the file is saved
	  as a Viewwave .GEN file; the file may then be viewed in Viewwave.

	  Retrieve previous snapshots saved by 'export' with 'import'.
	  The file must be in XChecker binary format.
	  
     group [group_name] [signal_list]
	  The 'group' command defines a  group_name for a set of signals.
	  This group can then be used as the signal name in the 'pick'
	  command.  Typing 'group' without any arguments displays all
	  signal groups.

     history
	  Displays commands entered during the current sessions. As in
	  UNIX, previously entered commands may be executed by specifying
	  '!<command_number>'. Only the last 20 commands entered are
	  retained.

     import save_file
	  The 'import' command retrieves previous snapshots saved by the
	  'export' command. The file must be in XChecker binary format.

	  option to open a new logfile. The -on and -off toggle logging
	  on and off.

     quit [-nsave]
	  Quits the current XChecker session. The -nsave option exits the 
	  program without saving the profile in the 'xchecker.pro' file. Same
	  as the 'exit' command.

     path path_name1 path_name2 ... path_name_n
	  Specifies the current working directory.

     part part_name
	  Specify LCA device package in use. If no part name is specified
	  the current parttype is displayed along with a list of valid
  	  part names.

     pick [-clear -all -add|-delete] [-bin|-oct|-dec|-hex] [*|signal_list]
	  Setup the display format for the signal list. The signals
	  defined in the display list are a subset of the signals
	  defined in probe list.  This command affects the way data is
	  displayed when the 'show' command is used. This command is the same
	  as the 'display' command.

     port portname
	  Set or change the cable communication port.

     probe [-clear -all -add|-delete] [*|signal_list]
	  The 'probe' command specifies which signals to extract when a
	  target LCA is read back.  A signal name must be listed in the
	  design.LL file.

     readback [-a] [-c] #snapshots
	  Take #snapshots of the target LCA.  Each snapshot is one full
	  readback of the target.  Use -a to append new snapshot data to
	  previous values, -c to readback the target LCA's configuration.

     reset [-cable | -target]
	  Reset the cable hardware (-c) or pulse RESET line to reset
	  the target LCA (-t). No arguments has the same effect as -t.

     save
	  Save current session settings in the file 'xchecker.pro'.

     settings
	  Display current environment settings.

     show [-signal x y] [-snapshot n m] [-tabular|-vdata] [-text|-hdata]
	  Show data captured after a readback or series of snapshots are
	  performed.  Data is displayed in the format specified by the
	  'pick' command.

     status
	  Display the status of the cable hardware.

     trigger [-auto|-manual|-none] [-clock #x #y] [-timeout #t] [-reset]
	  Setup triggering events to be used in a subsequent readback or
	  series of snapshots.

     verify [name]
	  Verify if the recent download is correct.

     version
	  Displays version information about the XChecker software.

     where filename
	  Searches directories specified by the XChecker 'path' variable
	  for the specified filename.

     Extended help is available for XChecker commands and error messages
     at the XCHECKER? prompt in the interactive mode.

     For help in a specific command type 'help <command_name>' at the
     XCHECKER? prompt.

     For an explanation of a error or warning message type the following:

     XCHECKER? help e001 <enter>   <==== for specific help on ERROR 001

     XCHECKER? help w001 <enter)   <==== for specific help on WARNING 001

.INDEX where
     where filename
     Abbrev: wh

	  The 'where' command searches directories specified by the 
	  XChecker 'path' environment variable for the specified filename.
	  If the file is found, its full path is printed. If the file is
	  not found there is no output.

.INDEX history
     history
     Abbrev: hi

	  The 'history' command is similar to the UNIX command in
	  that it displays the command history for the current session.
	  Command history is kept for the current session only and is 
	  lost when the XChecker software is exited.

	  The !<command_number> convention may be used to execute previously
	  entered commands. Only the 20 most recent commands are retained.

	  Example:

		XCHECKER ? load test2			   <== download file
 
		About to download 'test2.bit'.		   <== screen output
		Press ENTER key to continue or Q to quit:
		> 
		Total of 2236 bytes transmitted.
		DONE signal went high.
		Transmitting time =  1.15 secs
		XCHECKER ? readback -c			   <== readback
		Readback 2230 bytes of configuration	  
		XCHECKER ? history			   <== show history
   		   1  load test2
    		   2  readback -c
    		   3  history
		XCHECKER ? !2				   <== execute command
		Readback 2230 bytes of configuration           two again
		XCHECKER ? 

.INDEX !
     !<command_number>
	  
	  The !<command_number> convention may be used to execute previously
	  entered commands. Use the 'history' command to see the history
	  list.
	
	  Example:

    		   3  history
		XCHECKER ? !2				   <== execute command
		Readback 2230 bytes of configuration           two again
		XCHECKER ? 

.INDEX alias
     alias name definition
     Abbrev: ali
	
	  The 'alias' command allows commands, batch file sequences,
	  and other operations to be assigned to a user defined name.
	  All aliases assigned during a session are saved in the profile
	  file 'xchecker.pro'.

	  If no arguments are included all current aliases are printed.

.INDEX batch
     < batchname
     batch batchname

	  Execute commands specified in a file. The default file
	  extension is '.cmd'

	  Example:
		       batch xyz
		  or   < xyz

.INDEX baud
     baud baudrate
     Abbrev: bau

	  Specify new the communication baud rate for the XChecker or serial 
	  cable. The valid baud rates are:

			  9600   19200  38400 115200

	       APOLLO       X      X      X
	       DEC3100      X
	       SUN          X      X      X

	  At initialization, the fastest baud rate is selected based
	  on the host system's capability.

.INDEX browse
     browse [filename]
     Abbrev: br

	  The 'browse' command allows the user to view a text file.  It
	  is similar to the MS-DOS 'more' command. This command works 
	  only on PC platforms.

.INDEX error
     Error Messages

	  For an explanation of an error message type the following:

	  XCHECKER? help e001 <enter>   <==== for specific help on ERROR 001

	  XCHECKER? help w001 <enter)   <==== for specific help on WARNING 001

.INDEX log
     log [-on|-off] [-out filename] "string"
     Abbrev: log

	  The 'log' command is used to direct screen output to a specified
	  file. The -out option is used to specify the name of the log file.
	  The "string" field allows the user to add comments to the log file,
	  in addition to the data captured on the screen.  The command
	  'log "string"' may be used after a log file has been opened.

	  The -on and -off options toggle data capture on and off to
	  the current logfile. The -out option must be used to open
	  a logfile before the -on and -off options are used.

	  A log file will remain open until another 'log -out filename'
	  is executed the or the XChecker program is exited.

	  Note that commands typed at the XCHECKER? prompt are not captured
	  in the log file.

	  Example:
		log -out capture.txt         <=== XChecker opens a new log
						  file called 'capture.txt'
		probe A B C D E F
		pick A B C D E F
		trigger -none -clock 0 1
		readback 3
		log This is counter #1       <=== XChecker inserts the user
						  comment into the log file
		show

		------ ABCDEF                <=== screen output from XChecker
		    0: 000000                     is also captured to log file
		    1: 000001           
		    2: 000010

.INDEX part

     part part_name
     Abbrev: pa

	  Specify the LCA device type in use.  This command is required if
	  target verification or signal probing is to be performed. There
	  should be a <device_type>.ll in the search path. Specify the device
	  type as follows:

	       Example:
			 part XC4005         <== the device type is an XC4005           
			 part XC3042L        <== the device type is an XC3042L

	  In addition to the <device_type>.LL file, an design.LL file
	  is required to probe signals from a downloaded design. 

	  If no parttype is specified, the current type will be displayed
	  along with a list of available parttypes. The file 'xpart.def'
	  in the XACT data directory determines the available parts.

.INDEX ls
     ls [-s] filemask
     Abbrev: ls

	  List directory entries of the matching filemask. If option
	  -s is specified, the Xilinx search path (XACT environment and
	  subdirectories) is used to look for matching files.

#.INDEX dump [ -bin | -oct | -dec | -hex ] [ -s start_addr ] [ -l number_of_bits ]
#     dump
#     Abbrev: du
#
#	  This command dumps data captured by a 'readback' or 'verify'
#	  command. The data is displayed on byte boundaries and is
#	  unformated. Available options are:
#
#	  -bin	   Display the data in binary format.
#	 
#	  -oct	   Display the data in octal format.
#
#	  -dec     Display the data in decimal format.
#
#	  -hex     Display the data in hexadecimal format.
#
#	  -s start_addr
#		   Data is normally displayed 16 bytes at a time.  This option
#		   sets the starting address for the data to be displayed.
#
#	  -l number_of_bits
#		   Overrides the 16 byte block display default and specifies
#		   the total amount of data to be displayed.
#
#	     Example:
#	
#		   dump -bin -s 100 -l 14000	<== Sets the display format to
#						    binary, dump data starting
#						    at byte address 100, and 
#						    display a total of 14000 bits
#
#
.INDEX save
     save
     Abbrev: sa

	  This command saves the current session settings to the file
	  'xchecker.pro'. If a previous 'xchecker.pro' is
	  found in the search path, the file is updated with the new settings.
	  If no file is found, a new 'xchecker.pro' will be created in the
	  current directory.

.INDEX sys
     sys command
     Abbrev: sys

	  The 'sys' command executes a system command.  On IBM PCs running DOS,
	  a new DOS shell is invoked if no command is specified. The user
	  must type 'exit' to return to the XChecker session.  The field
	  'command' specifies a command to execute; when execution is finished
	  the user is returned to the XChecker session.

	       Examples:
			  sys lca2xnf test.lca tout.xnf
			  sys rm *.bak

.INDEX diag
     diag [-p ] num [ -np ]
     Abbrev: dia

	  The 'diag' command runs the XChecker diagnostic test routines.  Each
	  diagnostic test consists of three low level XChecker tests.  The tests
	  consists of (1) a communications check, (2) hardware register check,
	  and (3) an XChecker SRAM memory check.

	  The -p option causes XChecker to pause between each test.  The 'num'
	  field specifies the number of times to run the above three tests.

	  The -np option suppresses the "press ENTER" prompt normally displayed
	  before executing the diagnostics test.

.INDEX load
     load [-v] design -np
     Abbrev: loa

	  Read the specified design and download it to the user's target
	  LCA device. With -v option, the design will be immediately read back
	  and verified to make sure the recent download process is correct.
	  If you want to verify a device after configuring it, type 'verify'.

	  The -np (no pause) option supresses the prompt to press ENTER,
	  and immediately begins the configuration process.

	       Example:
			 load demo3020
			 load -v ~xact/designs/4kdemo

.INDEX reset
     reset [-cable|-target]
     Abbrev: res

	  The 'reset' command is used in two types of resets.  If the -cable
	  option is used, the XChecker cable is forced into a hardware reset.
	  Use this option if communication errors are experienced.

	  Without the -cable option, the RESET pin on XChecker is pulsed once.
	  The RESET pin on XChecker is active low.  The -target option
	  has the same effect.

.INDEX port
     port portname
     Abbrev: po

	  The 'port' command specifies the name of the port to be used by the
	  cable for communications. If you are using the Parallel download
	  cable, valid ports are 'lpt1', 'lpt2', or 'lpt3'.
	  
	  If you using the XChecker cable or Serial download cable, the 
	  following RS232 ports are valid for the listing platform. 
	 
	       IBM         com1         com2         com3       com4
	       
	       NEC         com1

	       APOLLO      /dev/sio1    /dev/sio     /dev/sio2

	       DEC3100     /dev/ttyd0   /dev/ttyd1

	       SUN         /dev/ttya    /dev/ttyb

	  If port is defined as 'AUTO', all communication ports are scanned
	  to search for a cable.

	       Example:
			 port /dev/ttyb      <== define port explicitly
			 port auto           <== scan all available ports

.INDEX resume
     resume     
     Abbrev: resu

	  Resume or restart the free running system clock on XChecker's CLKO
	  pin. This command is used during single stepping/probing of a
	  target LCA. The following example illustrates this:

	       Example:
			 <Power Up target... Target is running>

			 break          # Stop the system clock on the CLKO pin
			 reset          # Reset the system
			 clock 2034     # Generate 2034 system clocks
			 readback 5     # Readback 5 snapshots

			<Show/View the snapshots>

			clock 123      # Extra 123 clocks
			readback 5     # Read 5 snap shots

			<Show/View the snap shots>

			resume         # Back to free running

.INDEX status
     status      
     Abbrev: st

	  This 'status' command displays the current status of the cable
	  hardware. The levels of the following signals are sampled and
	  displayed.

	       RESET=0   INIT=1    D/P=1     PROG=1
	       CCLK=1    TRIG=1    RT=0      RD=0

	  Note that the TRIG pin is registered, so if a hardware
	  has been previously detected the TRIG pin will be shown as 'high'.

.INDEX verify
     verify [design_name] [-m]
     Abbrev: ve

	  Verify if a previous download or configured LCA is correct.
	  Verification is done by reading back the target device configuration
	  data and comparing it to a .BIT or PROM data file (.MCS, .TEK, .EXO).
	  (If a PROM data file is used, be sure to set the device parttype
	  using the 'part' command).

	  This command differs from 'load -v design' command in that the target
	  LCA is not configured with the bitstream before verification.

	  After verification, a message is displayed displaying the results of
	  the comparison.  If a target LCA's configuration data is the same as
	  the original data file the message 'VERIFIED' will be displayed.
	  If any bits did not compare the number of bytes mismatching will
	  be shown.

	  If 'verify' is typed without a design name, the most recent downloaded
	  bitstream or PROM file is used as the comparison file.

	  The -m option will display any data that does not match the original
	  .BIT file; bits which are '0' but read back as a '1' are marked with a
	  '+' character, and bits which are '1' but read back as '0' are
	  marked with a '-' character.

	  If the readback data matches the original bitstream, the -m option
	  has no effect.

.INDEX break
     break     
     Abbrev: bre

	  The 'break' command stops the free-running clock on XChecker's CLKO
	  pin. This command is used to enable the single step feature.
	  This command is similar in function to the command 'clock -stop'.
	  To start the free-running clock again type 'resume' or 'clock -resume'.

.INDEX clock

     clock [-int|-ext -speed 1|3|5|11] [-stop|-resume] nclocks
     Abbrev: cl

	  Specify the origin, speed, and number of clocks generated on
	  XChecker's CLKO pin.

	  -ext      Indicate that the system clock is generated from the user's
		    board, applied at XChecker's CLKI pin, and passed out the
		    CLKO pin. (The clock at the CLKI pin must be between 120 Hz
		    and 10 MHz.)

	  -int      Indicate that the system clock is generated from XChecker's
		    internal crystal; any clocks on the CLKI pin are ignored.

	  -speed #  Setup system clock speed where

		    1:   0.921 MHz    ( Period = 1.086 uS )
		    3:   2.75  MHz    ( Period = 363.6 nS )
		    5:   5.50  MHz    ( Period = 181.8 nS )
		   11:  11.00  MHz    ( Period = 90.9 nS )
			
		    If XC3000L or XC2000L devices are to be read back or
		    verified, clock speed 3 is replaced with a slower
		    70kHz clock.

	  -stop     This option stops the free-running clock on XChecker's
		    CLKO pin.  This option must be used before single
		    stepping can begin.  The 'break' command is equivalent
		    to this option.
	  
	  -resume   The -resume option restores the free-running clock to
		    XChecker's CLKO pin.  The 'resume' command is equivalent
		    to this option.

	  nclocks   Indicate the number of clocks (0-32767) to be generated
		    either between readback snapshots, or to single step the
		    target LCA.

	  This command also affects the speed of clocks used during readback
	  snapshots of XC4000 devices.  XC4000 devices may be readback at
	  settings of 1, 3, or 5.  If a speed of 11 is specified and the -int
	  option is used, the burst clock between snapshots will be at 11 MHz,
	  but actual readback clocks will be at 5.5 MHz.  If the -ext option is
	  specified the -speed option may be used to set the readback clock
	  speed also.

	  Not specifying the -speed option selects the default readback speed
	  for all device families, 0.921 MHz.  XC2000 and XC3000(A) family 
	  readback clock speed is fixed at 0.921 MHz.  

	  XC3000L and XC2000L (3V) family devices are read back at 70kHz. If
	  a 'verify' or 'readback' command is executed, the 2.75MHz clock
	  speed is replaced with a 70kHz clock.  This clock speed is also
	  on the CLKO pin.

.INDEX display
     display [-bin|-oct|-dec|-hex] [-add|-delete|-all] [*|signal_list] [-clear]
     Abbrev: dis

	  The 'display' command is the same as the 'pick' command.  Please see
	  the entry for 'pick'.

.INDEX pick
     pick [-bin|-oct|-dec|-hex] [-add|-delete|-all] [*|signal_list] [-clear]
     Abbrev: pi

	  The 'pick' command is used to setup the display format of the signal
	  list.  The signals defined in the display list are a subset of
	  the signals defined in the probe list or signal names defined in the
	  design.LL file.  This command is the same as the 'display' command.

	  -bin      This option displays signals in binary format.

	  -oct      This option displays signals in octal format.

	  -hex      This option displays signals in hex format.

	  -dec      This option displays signals in decimal format.

	  -add|-delete|-all
		    Use the [-add|-delete|-all] [signal_list] to add or
		    delete signals to/from the display set.

	   -clear   This option is equivalent to -delete -all.

	   Examples:

		pick -bin -add address_data  <=== adds signal address_data in
						  binary format to the
						  display list

		pick -hex bus_name           <=== adds signal bus_name to the
						  display list in hex format

		pick -delete -all            <=== removes all signals from
						  the display list

	  This command can also be used to modify any previous display settings.
	  Typing 'pick' without any options displays a list of selected signals.

	  Example of typical session:

	       probe u1 u2 u3 u4 u5 u6 u7 u8 u9 <=== extract signals u1 to u9
	       readback 5                            from the data read back
	       pick u4 u3                            from the target LCA
	       show
	       >  u4     00101                  <=== output from XChecker
	       >  u3     11001

.INDEX probe
help     probe [-add|delete] [*|signal_list] [-all] [-clear]
     Abbrev: pr

	  The 'probe' command is used to add or delete signals from
	  the list of signals to be read back from a target LCA.
	  This list defines a "mask" which is used by the XChecker
	  hardware to extract the desired signals and states.  All signals
	  specified must be in the design.LL file to be "probable."

	  -add|-delete
		    This option adds or deletes signals from the probing list.

	  -all      This option selects all probable signals in the
		    design.LL file.

	  -clear    This option removes all signals from the probe list;
		    equivalent to 'probe -delete -all'.

	  Examples:

	       probe U1 U2 U3 U4             <=== add these signals to the list
	       probe U3                      <=== only add U3 to the probe list
	       probe -add -all               <=== add all signals to the list

.INDEX export
     export [-v|-viewlogic] save_file
     Abbrev: exp

	  Saves the current readback data to the file save_file.
	  Default save_file format is XChecker binary format.
	  With the -v or -viewlogic option, the file is saved
	  as a Viewwave .GEN file; the file may then be viewed in
	  Viewlogic Viewwave.

	  Previously saved XChecker binary files may be retrieved
	  by using the 'import' command.

.INDEX import
     import save_file
     Abbrev: im

	  The 'import' command retrieves previous snapshots saved by the 
	  'export' command. The file must be in XChecker binary format.

.INDEX group
     group [group_name] [signal_list]
     Abbrev: gr

	  The 'group' command defines a group_name for a set of signals.
	  This group can then be used as a signal name in the 'pick'
	  command.  
	 
	  Typing 'group' without any arguments displays all signal groups.

	  Example 1:

	       group address_bus a0 a1 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7  <=== defines signals
	       pick -hex address_bus                        a0-a7 as the 
	       pick u4 u3                                   single signal
	       readback 5                                   'address_bus'
	       show
	       > address_bus  AA
	       > u4      00101
	       > u3      11001
	       
	  Example 2:

	       group rom_data rom*   <============ defines all signals
						   in the design.LL
						   file with the
						   characters 'rom'
						   as the signal rom_data
.INDEX trigger
     trigger [-auto|-manual|-none] [-clock #x #y] [-timeout #t] [-reset]
     Abbrev: tr

	  The 'trigger' command sets up triggering events to be used
	  in subsequent readbacks.

	  -auto     The trigger to start a readback is provided by
		    a low to high transition on the XChecker TRIG pin.
		    This is also called a 'hardware' trigger.

	  -manual   The trigger to start a readback is provided by
		    the user pressing the ENTER key on the host
		    system keyboard.

	  -none     The readback will start immediately after the
		    'readback' command is issued.  No external
		    event will trigger a readback.

	  -clock #x #y
		    After detecting a trigger, the XChecker software will
		    insert #x clocks before the first readback snapshot,
		    and #y clocks between each subsequent snapshot. This
		    option is only functional if XChecker's CLKO pin is
		    attached to the target system.

	 -timeout #t
		    This option specifies the amount of time XChecker should
		    wait for a trigger to start a readback.  If a trigger
		    is not received within #t seconds, the readback is
		    canceled (#t must be an integer between 0 and 32767).

	 -reset     Tells XChecker to reset the target system before starting
		    a readback.  A high-to-low-to-high pulse is sent on
		    XChecker's RESET line.

	 Examples:
		   trigger -manual           <=== XChecker will wait for a
		   readback 1                     keypress before starting
						  the readback; one snapshot
						  is taken.

		   trigger -auto -clock 2 5  <=== readback triggered by a
		   readback 10                    low to high transition on
						  XChecker's TRIG pin, insert
						  two clocks before the first
						  snapshot and insert five
						  clocks between each subsequent
						  snapshot.  Ten snapshots
						  will be taken.

		   trigger -none             <=== XChecker initiates two
		   readback 2                     readback snapshots
						  immediately after the
						  'readback 2' command
						  is issued.

.INDEX show
     show [-signal x y] [-snapshot n m] [-tabular|-vdata] [-text|-hdata]
     Abbrev: sh

	  The 'show' command displays data read back in the format specified
	  by the 'pick' command.

	  -signal x y
	       The signal option is used to select the number of signals to
	       be displayed, beginning with the 'x' signal and the number
	       of signals to show (y) after signal x.  
	       
	       Signals 'x' and 'y' are integer values of the desired signals
	       as entered in the 'pick' list; i.e., if signal 'A' was the
	       first signal entered in the display set, it is referred to as
	       signal '0', if signal 'D' was the fourth signal entered in
	       the display set, it is referred to as signal '3'.  See the
	       example following this list.

	       This option is useful for selecting a set of signals without 
	       modifying the display set (signals set up by the 'pick' command).

	  -snapshot n m
	       The snapshot option defines the number of the first snapshot
	       to show (n) and the number of snapshots to show (m) after
	       snapshot n.

	  -vdata|-tabular
	       The signal data is displayed vertically from top to bottom.
	       This is the default mode.

	  -hdata|-text
	       The signal data is displayed horizontally from left to right.

	  Example:

		    probe A B C D E F        <=== signals to be extracted from
						  target

		    pick A B C D E F         <=== signals to be viewed

		    trigger -none -clock 0 1 <=== start readback immediately

.INDEX readback
     readback [-a] [-c] #snapshot
     Abbrev: rea

	  The 'readback' command reads back one or more snapshots
	  from the target LCA.  The maximum number of snapshots to be taken
	  is indicated by #snapshot.  No number specified generates
	  a single snapshot.

	  -a    The -a option appends additional snapshots to those previously
		taken.

	  -c    The -c option reads back the target LCA configuration data.
		This is similar to the 'verify' command, except the retrieved
		data is not compared with the original bitstream.

	  #snapshot
		This variable specifies the number of snapshots, or subsequent
		readbacks to be performed.

	  Special triggering requirements should be set up using the
	  'trigger' command before the 'readback' command is issued.
	  At completion, the user can use the 'show' command to the
	  captured data.

	  Example:

		probe A B C D E F          <=== setup signals to probe
		pick A B C D               <=== signals to view
		trigger -none -clock 0 1   <=== setup trigger requirements
		readback 5                 <=== read back five snapshots
		show                       <=== show the captured data

.INDEX exit
     exit [-nsave]       
     Abbrev: exi

	  The 'exit' command terminates the current XChecker session, if typed
	  at the XCHECKER? prompt.  The user is then asked if the xchecker.pro
	  file should be updated. 

	  If the -nsave option is specified, the profile information is not
	  saved the file 'xchecker.pro'.

	  If typed at a system prompt originally created by the 'sys' command,
	  the command shell is terminated and the user is returned to the
	  XChecker session.

	  This command is the same as the 'quit' command.

.INDEX quit
     quit [-nsave]
     Abbrev: qu

	  The 'quit' command terminates the current XChecker session, if typed
	  at the XCHECKER? prompt.  The user is then asked if the xchecker.pro
	  file should be updated.

	  If the -nsave option is specified, the profile information is not

'diag', 'verify', or 'readback' commands.

.INDEX e004  

ERROR 004: Not enough memory.

The error usually occurs on DOS and Windows based platforms. The normal
version of the XChecker software is a protected mode program. On a 386
or higher computer XChecker uses extended memory. Check the configuration
of your memory manager (QEMM, HIMEM.SYS, etc) for proper usage. Also,
try moving TSRs into upper memory (the region above the 640KB barrier) to 
free conventional memory. 

A second "non-protected mode" version of the XChecker software is 
provided for use on 8088, 8086, and 286 based machines. It is called
'xck88.exe'. This version requires a minimum of 512 kB free base RAM. 
Make sure no other program or TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident
application, i.e., mouse drivers, network drivers, window drivers,
etc.) is running simultaneous with XChecker.

If you are running XChecker from another program, for example Workview,
type "exit" at the DOS command line and return to your first application.
Quit that application, and run XChecker again.

Other applications may also be running. Type 'EXIT' at the DOS command
prompt to return to a previously loaded application and exit the program.
