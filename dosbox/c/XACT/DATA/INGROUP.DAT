# The 8 fields in each pattern line are:
# type, source_belname, source_pin, load_belname, load_pin, max_sources,
# max_pat_loads, value.

#   "May" group patterns represent types of netlist connections between two symbols
# that, when they occur, mean that it is highly desirable but not absolutely
# necessary that the two symbols be grouped into one block.  By contrast,
# a "must" group pattern indicates a connection between two symbols that are
# REQUIRED to be in the same block.
#   A '*' in a pin field means any pin qualifies the symbol for grouping.
#   Max_sources is the maximum allowed number of symbols with the associated
# source_belname that can be grouped with a symbol of the given load_belname.
#   Max_pat_loads is the maximum allowed number of load symbols with the
# associated load_belname and load_pin that can be grouped through a net driven
# by a symbol of the given source_belname.
#   "Value" indicates the relative importance of the grouping.
#   The pin names below are matched by Mxnpin->archpin->name; these strings
# are typically the same as the belpin names.  The only exceptions are
# fg input pins.  Since wildcards are now used for these (see first "may group"),
# this does not cause a problem.
