# EDIT THIS FILE WITH CARE.  IT CONTAINS VARIABLE SETTINGS WHICH WILL APPLY
# TO MOST ALL DS502 PROGRAMS FOR ALL USERS.
#
# If you want to adjust the values for yourself for all programs and designs, 
# you can create an xactinit.dat file in your home directory (On the PC, the 
# home directory is controlled by the HOME environmental variable; if there 
# is no such variable, it will default to the C:\ directory). 
#
# You can also create an xactinit.dat file in a design directory; the values
# assigned in that file will be effective only for programs run in that directory.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# USER_SEARCH_PATH
# This variable helps control where the data manager looks for files.
# It is appended to the standard search path.  The directory names you add 
# should be fully qualified directory names that end in a slash.  Dos 
# directory specifications should include the drive letter.  For example:
# DOS:   user_search_path = d:\the\full\path\to\the\dir\
# UNIX:  user_search_path = /the/full/path/to/the/directory/
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# To define this variable, remove the "#" at the start of the next line
# user_search_path =
