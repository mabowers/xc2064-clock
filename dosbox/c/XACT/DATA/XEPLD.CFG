To define alias names for 20V8 and 22V10 compatible PAL equation files
{these are the shipped defaults}:

  (alias pl20v8 pal20v8;gal20v8;g20v8;p20v8;p20v8r;20v8)
  (alias pl22v10 pal22v10;gal22v10;p22v10;g22v10;22v10)

Enclose the following advanced user switches in parentheses to enable them.


The following control when plusasm splits equations with too many product
terms and the size of the split subfunctions it creates. The first only
affects internal nodes {external outputs are not split unless otherwise
impossible to map}. The first is the shipped default; there is no
default limit shipped for the second:

  (alias max_shared_before_splitting 12)
  alias max_shared_after_splitting   1

The following switch attempts to continuously split equations which use shared
pterms so that the function blocks do not run out of shared pterms.
This switch will continue to split nodes until we run out of macrocells.      
Using this switch will not affect the timing of the design, although it will 
tend to fill most of the macrocells on the device, 

   alias auto_node_split yes


To disable the munching of high-order arithetic bits.  Useful for 4.0
designs where you have cascaded arithmetic functions using pin
assignment. {New designs name all adder outputs in a PARTITION statement.}:

  alias preserve_arithmetic yes

To disable splitting of all or specified equations.  The partitioner
can probably map 22-25 inputs functions using the UIM if you tell
it not to split them. To inhibit all splitting:

  alias do_not_split "all"

To avoid splitting signals S1 and S2 use:

  alias do_not_split "s1 s2"

The following tells vmh2pld to always disable preload optimization.
This is an alternative the user can use to avoid modifying old schematics:

  alias preload_opt_off yes

To use old {version 4.1 & earlier} default of nodetrst instead of
pintrst:

  alias nodetrst on

Specify maximum number of pterms in an FFB output.  This limit is used 
by the collapser to decide how much in can collapse into an FFB output.
The default limit is 4, but can be overwritten with this alias:

  alias ffb_pterm_limit 36
