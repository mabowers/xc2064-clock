    The gl16mode.xct file is used to describe basic capabilities of a
    graphics adapter to the XACT graphics code.  This file is NOT
    capable of describing all of the capabilities of every graphics
    adapter;  quite the opposite is in fact true.  It is capable of
    describing the few simple attributes of graphics adapters which are
    needed to specify the information needed for graphics modes which
    store bit plane data the same way the vga adapter does.

    Some video adapters which support resolutions beyond the VGA 640 by
    480 resolution do so by organizing video memory in ways that are
    different from the IBM VGA standard.  Such graphics modes are not
    currently supported, although they may be in the future.

    The gl16mode.xct file consists on one line per supported video
    mode.  Each line is considered to be a string of colon (':')
    separated tokens.  These tokens specify the video mode, and data
    concerning that video mode.  Some tokens are simple keywords,
    others are keyword=value pairs.

    The first token in each line is a name.  This name is the name used
    on the XACT command line, or as the value of the GRMODE environment
    variable.

    The following keywords are supported:

    mode	This keyword is used to specify the video mode passed
		to the adapter BIOS.  It is of the form mode=<value>.
		<Value> may be decimal or hex, hex indicated by a leading
		"0x" in the value.

		For example, some third party super VGA adapters use mode
		0x54 to specify 800x600 16 color VGA mode.  Others use
		0x58.  The entries for these two video modes would differ
		only in this value.  (They must of course have different
		names.)
			
    egamem	This is the amount of memory which must be installed on the
		video adapter to support this video mode.  If this number is
		0 no checking for memory will be done.  Otherwise the
		graphics code will interpret this number as a number of K
		bytes of memory, and will query the adapter to see if that
		amount of memory is present.  Specified as egamem=<value>
		where <value> is a decimal number of K bytes.

    planes	Specifies the number of bit planes required by this mode.
		Specified as planes=<value> where <value> is a decimal number.

    colors	Specifies the number of colors allowed by this mode.
		Specified as colors=<value> where <value> is a decimal number.

    charw	Character width in pixels.
		Specified as charw=<value> where <value> is a decimal number.

    charh	Character hight in pixels.
		Specified as charw=<value> where <value> is a decimal number.

    screenw	Screen width in pixels.
		Specified as screenw=<value> where <value> is a decimal number.

    screenh	Screen hight in pixels.
		Specified as screenw=<value> where <value> is a decimal number.

    vga		States that this is a VGA video mode.  No value.
		If this is specified, graphics will check to make sure
		that a VGA capable adapter is installed.

    ega		States that this is an EGA video mode.  No value.
		If this is specified, graphics will check to make sure
		that an EGA capable adapter is installed.

    cga		States that this is a CGA video mode.  No value.
		If this is specified, graphics will check to make sure
		that a CGA capable adapter is installed.

    maskfile	Specifies one of cgamask.xcb, egamask.xcb, or vgamask.xcb.

    description Text which will be printed as help by the graphics system
		All text to the next colon or to the end of line is taken
		as the value of this keyword.

    The gl16mode.xct file itself can be checked for examples.
